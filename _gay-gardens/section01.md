*It’s not fair, Mummy, to buy her a farm at this stage; she won’t be able to live on it all by herself and she’ll be almost forced to stay with that Rosie, who may or may not take drugs but seems to be in a chronically abnormal state.* 

\- Fiona Millar, 1971

    
*The cat's going to the bathroom right right in back of my portrait. I’m glad he is. I’m glad somebody’s doing something they want to do.*  

\- Edith Bouvier Beale, *Grey Gardens*
