My mother just calls it St. Margaret’s Home. The word *incurable* had long been removed from the name.{% include feature/aside.html text="'What is meant by Incurable? A disease called incurable in one generation, is curable in the next. A disease incurable by one man, is curable by another. A disease called curable, ends in a painful death; a disease called incurable, is borne with little suffering through a long life, and after all is not the cause of death'.<br><br>

It had fallen out of common use, too absolute to contain hope for the future of anyone saddled with such a bleak diagnosis. The word was replaced by more specific language denoting chronic illness and palliative care, accounting for an increasingly precise medical landscape.

The facility, which was by Dot’s era a home for women alone, was administered by the Sisterhood of Saint Margaret, and Dot was the president of the board.  In her position, she introduced a medical advisor for the residents, as well as a regular physician, Dr. Bayne, who was a pioneer of geriatric medicine in Canada.  She modernized the building, arranged for the installation of an elevator, the construction of a proper kitchen and dining room.   

The Sisterhood of Saint Margaret, a nursing order, solicited funds for the home, employed the floor staff, and tended to the residents spiritual needs. Over the years, the nuns faded into the background, until the home was secularized in 1975\.  A picture of the interior of the facility from 1933 shows them standing in the corners, heads bowed, faces shielded by their habits.  To me, they seem sinister, although they are in good company; each resident stares into the camera, unsmiling.  

The term *incurable,* in its day, had often been conflated with a sense of morality. An incurable was at once medically and morally so. While St Margaret’s Home was more assisted living facility than hospital, so too was it a product of the philosophies of its time{% include feature/aside.html text="Of the era, medical historian Jason Szabo writes: “As the [19th] century progressed, doctors increasingly concurred that some combination of nature and nurture generated a fatal ﬂaw in the chronically ill.”" %}, charged with the care of those who were excluded, by reason of poverty or medical need, from other facilities or from the possibility of living independently.  Poverty and disability are, even today, too often disparaged as the result of personal failures, of weak-wills and defeatism. I have to imagine that these judgements, too, crept into the ethos of St Margaret’s Home, although to what degree, I can’t say.  

I can see myself casting about for a narrative here.  I want a sense of my great-grandmother, of her motivations and beliefs.  The Dot my mother remembers was fastidious, scientifically-minded, and emotionally distant. Her grandmother was a doctor, her grandfather, a baptist minister, and the two vocations seemed to have shaped her equally. She had a rigid sense of propriety, clear on the roles of men and women, despite her own, arguably radical medical interests. Her service at St Margaret’s home was informed by a commitment to medical advancements, and a commitment to religious service.  I can only speculate from here: Did this idea of the incurable, the morally compromised, shape her scientific curiosity? Did her commitment to science contradict, or complement her religious conviction?
