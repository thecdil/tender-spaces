*J'aimais les espaces tendres, les verts anglais d'emeraude et de silence, ton odeur, tu illuminais l'air dont je me défends*  
*et selon mon oreille reste l'espace de tes doigts finissants, à douter et rougir parfois des confiances pales, si étranges, si tendre et rouge de mon enfance.*  
\-       “Lettre à mon tuteur”, Gaëtane Buttigieg

Mas Lombard faces the city of Nîmes on one side, faces a potato field on the other, although neither can be seen from the property; a line of poplar trees stands to the East, clusters of fruit trees hide the city to the West.  An old stone wall is hidden under madeira ivy and passion flower vines.  They creep up the sides of the house, lacing through the iron grilles of the upstairs windows.  In the summer, meals are taken in the courtyard, and a dense Bourbon rose is trained above the tables, extending the shade of the house.  

Gaëtane and Hélène had been together for three years when they bought the Mas.  The roof needed to be replaced, and the windows, and the plaster siding had crumbled in patches, exposing the stone structure underneath.  The barn, which had been appropriated by the French Army to house Laotian workers during World War I, was badly in need of repair.  A map of Laos was still faintly visible, painted up to the roofbeams on the South wall.

The first time I visited, I was thirteen years old.  I slept in the attic \- I remember reading Terry Pratchett books underneath the low ceiling, and climbing up and down the spiral staircase that had only recently been rebuilt.  Then, as now, the house was a work in progress – there were chickens, but no coop, and the birds ran free around the property.  I spent hours in the pool, shaded by date palms and a walnut tree, splashing around with a neighbor girl named Martine, who was blunt and poised; around her, I stammered, and felt clumsy.  

My parents slept in a trailer under the plum trees.  When I return, twenty-odd years later, the trailer is full of firewood.  It has rotted out, dwarfed now by the fruit trees that rise above it, its siding flecked with the amaranth flesh of fallen plums.  

When I return, the property is much as I remember it, although everything seems to stand at a different angle, to cast a different shadow.  Things have grown, been built, or begun to rot.  Plantain shoots grow through the cracked cement around the pool.  The chickens are now sequestered under the walnut tree, although they strain their heads through the net enclosure, their necks bald from the effort.

I am in town for five days, on my way to a writing workshop, and I use the trip to Europe to visit my French cousins for the first time in my adult life.  They collect me at the train station, and we take a harrowing drive through the narrow streets of Nîmes before suddenly hinging onto a gravel road and pulling up to their gate.  Gaëtane is eager to walk me around the property.  She shows me the fruit trees \- plum, apricot, apple, pear, fig, olive \- and her little garden, tutting in disappointment at her blighted potatoes.  Their dog, Temis, bounds alongside us, a manic Doberman puppy, already stronger than each of his elderly owners. 

Inside their kitchen, a pot of what looks to be apricot jam cools on the stove \- it will remain there for the duration of my visit.  A cluster of uncorked bottles of wine sits on the counter.  That night, Hélène will sniff each one cautiously, unsure which had been opened the night before, and which had been there for weeks.  Through to the living room, a baby grand barely clears the doorframe.  On top of it, a carved jade ship, maybe a meter long and half as high, gathers dust next to a pile of mail and keys and dog treats.  Gaëtane’s paintings hang on every wall.

People in my community talk about queer family.   It is what we call our cherished friends, who see us, celebrate us, love us in the way that family should, sometimes a supplement to our own families, sometimes the only one we are left with.  Queerness is not a thing we inherit, and as such, queer families are pieced together, through proximity and shared experience.  Some of my friends have fraught relationships with their blood families, some in the slow process of repair, some severed forever \- for them, a chosen family is a lifeline.  

I am lucky.  I have had two families in my adult life, one chosen and one blood.  As children, our parents taught my sibling and me to trust that they would love whoever we became, and when we came out in the same year, they took it in stride.  But however comfortable we were in our own home, we were both enchanted by these cousins in France.  An overlap between the queer and the blood family felt like astonishing luck, and we talked about them whenever we could find a reason to.

There was so much catching up to do.  As a teenager, I was hungry for examples of queerness in the world.  During that first visit, I wanted to watch Gaëtane and Hélène just exist in their home, as remarkable or mundane as it was at any moment.  I wanted to see them hold hands, to watch them interact with shopkeepers, to meet the friends they had over for Sunday lunch.  But our stay was brief, and I could not yet articulate what it was that drew me to them.

When I return, Gaëtane’s sister is here, their sibling dynamic on full display.  I watch them from the outside; my French is fluent enough to participate, but the dry comments, the subtle sarcasm, forces my close focus.  *She’s always like this*, Olivia says to me in English when Gaëtane puts her foot down about their afternoon plans.  I try to understand how power works in their family, who is believed, who is defensive, who is the peacemaker.  I recognize my mother in Gaëtane, both oldest daughters, both stubborn and independent.  I recognize my grandmother, too, the way she tapped her clenched hands on the table, the way it felt as though a door had slammed shut when she made up her mind.  They pass a plate of cantaloupe around the table, bickering, juice dripping off their chins and fingers.  

Gaëtane’s mother Fiona and my grandmother were sisters.  They had been raised in my great-grandmother’s wealthy household in the Montreal suburbs.  Fiona moved to France and married, my grandmother stayed in Canada.  I wonder, as I watch Gaëtane and Olivia talk, about what we inherit, about how these people who I have spent so little time with feel so familiar to me.  I think again about queerness and inheritance too \- queerness, which exists despite our families or circumstance.  

Olivia is frustrated now, defending her right to protest as they discuss the King’s coronation.  Hélène suggests following France’s example and disposing of the royals entirely.  Gaëtane fixes the napkin on her lap, shrugging. Hélène looks at me and winks, a small smile on her face.  I smile back, reluctant to take a side in the squabble but thrilled to be included.  I feel thirteen again, bashful.  I want to claim these queer elders as my own, I want to say, *this is who showed me what my future could be.*  
   
When Olivia leaves, Gaëtane begins telling me stories about her life.  It’s after breakfast, and we’re sitting in the courtyard, under the Bourbon rose.  Two round patio tables are pushed together, covered in mismatched plastic tablecloths.  The ceramic pot of coffee is still on the table, cool now.  

Gaëtane came to Canada when she was sixteen, stayed with another of her mother’s sisters, my great aunt Nell.  *J’étais amoureux d'elle*, Gaëtane told me.  I wonder, for a moment, if I have misunderstood her, and try not to react with my eyes.  I remember my childhood visits with Nell.  She lived in a camper most of the time, in the dry woods of interior BC.  She raised horses, eked out a living taking care of other peoples’ ranches.  I remember her pack of salukis, lithe, long-haired sighthounds who stood as tall as I did, and the jeans and the boots that she wore.  

{% include essay/new-section.html %}  


Later, I read a poem that Gaëtane wrote about Nell.  *Ta voix me touche, j’invente des motifs de te parler. Tout prend des ombres particulières. // Tu me parles de responsabilité, de choses étonnantes et adultes et je voudrai t’entendre. Je ne cherche que le son de tes mots, non le sens et ne sais pas pourquoi.*  Your voice touches me, I invent reasons to speak to you, she writes.  I look only for the sound in your words, not the sense and know not why.  

I think again about the way my sibling and I wanted to be close to Gaëtane and Hélène.  Our interest was theoretical, but magnetic.  I wondered if Gaëtane’s love for Nell felt like that, like seeing a possible future in someone else.  I wondered if Nell could have been queer \- did she consider its possibility, during her solitude in the years that I knew her? \- or if Gaëtane had attached herself to her because she saw that she, too, was some kind of outsider at heart.

It is off handed, the way Gaëtane tells me about Chestnut Lodge.  *I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for ten months when I was eighteen, for being a lesbian,* she told me.  *Mais je faisais toutes sortes de bêtises.*  I must look shocked.  What kind of *bêtises,* what kind of antics would merit almost a year in a psychiatric facility?   

*Ask your mother,* she then said, and while my translation often missed nuance, I heard the bitterness there.  My mother, who had sung me lullabies that celebrated queerness.  Who was five years older than Gaëtane, 23 at the time, a teaching student at SFU, an environmental activist.  I wonder how Gaëtane sees my mother’s culpability, if she sees her as complicit in her exile.  At 23, did my mother know what it meant to be gay?  Did they talk about Gaëtane over family dinner, or was it vaguely phrased, some kind of infirmity, or hysteria?

Chestnut Lodge was famous, infamous in some eyes, for its pioneering psychological treatments.  A towering brick building with sweeping lawns and chestnut groves, it was a place where people of a certain means could send their family members for discreet treatment.  It was, Gaëtane told me, how you would imagine a psychiatric hospital to be at the time.  White-coated orderlies walked around the grounds with jangling rings of keys.  Access to the wider grounds had to be earned through good behavior.  *It broke my mind*, Gaëtane tells me.

*I escaped and married a man so they couldn’t send me back,* she says.  The details she shares are muddy \- she knew the man she married from a school she had attended in BC.  After they married, they stayed with friends, worked odd jobs to get by.  She moved back to France, divorced him after a few years, once her parents lost their legal pull over her.  I stumbled through my questions.  How could they force you into care?  What was your treatment?  Who was this man that you married?  She stands.  *What do you call this tree, un charbonnier?*  She walks to the edge of the courtyard, pulls down the branch of a charcoal tree. 

I find a letter from Chestnut Lodge to Nell.  *She has been doing some shopping and more and more is selecting softer feminine things,* they write.  *We find her a delightful young lady who is working hard at solving her problem in living.*  I find a letter from a friend to my great-grandmother.  *She is not either a boy or a girl, no amount of psychiatry will ever be able to alter this.*

Gaëtane and Hélène take me to the Mediterranean.  We set up folding chairs on the beach and wade into the water.  Their bathing suits contrast, Hélène’s dark against her white hair, Gaëtane’s light against a dark mop flecked with gray.  I take our picture, and Hélène makes a joke about their old bodies.  Water bombers practice above us, dipping into the ocean one after another and then releasing their contents way out at sea.  Gaëtane paddles out, drifting West with the current, while I stay in the warm shallows, surprised at how salty the water is.  We dry off in the sun, Gaëtane and Hélène holding each other's arms as they dress.  They move together without discussion, anticipating each others’ needs after years of practice.  I see that they are both wearing necklaces that Gaëtane made, wires twisted around green stones.

I find a letter from her husband to my great-grandmother:  *I would like to dispel any worries you have over the disappearance of Gaëtane.  She will remain with me in hiding until our marriage takes place.  At that time I will become her legal guardian and it is not my intention to permit her to return to Chestnut Lodge.  Regretfully, I cannot sign my name until we feel free from pursuit.*  Then, in a different hand, a curt proof of her presence:  *But I’ll sign mine.  Gaëtane.*

{% include essay/new-section.html %}  

Some months later, I will find the man Gaëtane married.  He owns a bookstore in my hometown, and I meet him there.  He sits amidst a pile of papers and coffee cups, his white hair down to his shoulders.  He was in love with her, it is clear.  *But*, he tells me, *I wasn’t going to change her from gay to straight*.  They hitchhiked back to the West Coast from Maryland.  *Gaëtane had short hair, she wore a plaid shirt and blue jeans, she looked like a young lad.*  The police went to his house, asked his roommates where he was.  Months later, he turned down an offer of ten thousand dollars from my great-grandmother to annul the marriage.  Does queer family include our protectors?  I marvel at this man’s loyalty to Gaëtane, at their short friendship, that he crossed a continent to guide her back to safety.

Hélène is preparing for *la cousinade.*  She picks up a case of wine from the cooperative vineyard, fusses around their yard.  Her niece comes over to play with Temis, who never runs out of energy.  An electrician is working in the studio, then sits down with us for lunch – I learn that he lived with them for a year, when he was out of work and raising a toddler on his own.  Hélène steps out to check on a friend, who is ninety and can no longer leave her home.  A neighbor comes over, smokes a cigarette by the pool and chats with Hélène’s niece.  We go for lunch, push three tables together, passing the tapenade one way and the breadbasket the other.

Gaëtane tells me that when she and Hélène got married after being together for 33 years, she asked her mother if she was happy for them.  Fiona said no.

*All she wants to do is paint,* Fiona wrote plaintively in a letter to my great-grandmother.

Gaëtane shows me around her art studio.  It is built into a loft above the barn, and she holds the railing as she climbs the steep stairs.  She wears her pajamas still, a faded gray set with pinstripes, and I can see the way her back curves through the thin cotton.    
We have to step up and duck through a doorway to get in, and the entryway is crammed with canvases.  Stacks of paintings line the walls, stand on shelves and lean against the wood stove at the center of the room.  Enormous paper lanterns hang from the high ceiling, and dried paint palettes rest on the tables.  Gaëtane sits on an old barber stool, her toes grazing the floor.  She is beaming, amused by my exclamations as I point around the room, wide-eyed.

Gaëtane sketched a cat and a unicorn at the top of a letter to my great-grandmother.  She wrote: *You see, I want to paint and make and create things.  The only job that I would get pleasure doing and which is within my means is that.*

On my last day at the Mas, I skim ants and flies off the surface of the pool.  I crouch in the water and scoop up the tiny snails that drift in the shallows.  Temis steals my towel from the arm of the cracked lawn chair.  Oleander blossoms litter the grass.  I am sometimes overwhelmed by the smells of this place; everything is damp and fertile.    
Back in the kitchen, Hélène tucks a chocolate wafer into my backpack, and a leftover curried chicken sandwich from lunch.  I stumble through thanks, promise to return, apologize that I don’t have the words for what I want to tell them.

{% include essay/new-section.html background-color="black" text-color="white"%}  


*Put that in your story,* Gaëtane says, about something else, I don’t remember what.  
   
*Où partent les mots que je n’ai jamais dits, ceux que je ne trouve pour respirer, pour paraître*  
*de constitution commune, non lentement imbécile, plate sur une terre mangée de cuillères?*
