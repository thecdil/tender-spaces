*It’s not fair, Mummy, to buy her a farm at this stage; she won’t be able to live on it all by herself and she’ll be almost forced to stay with that Rosie, who may or may not take drugs but seems to be in a chronically abnormal state.*  

\- Fiona Millar, 1971

*The cat's going to the bathroom right right in back of my portrait. I’m glad he is. I’m glad somebody’s doing something they want to do.*  

*\-* Edith Bouvier Beale, *Grey Gardens*

Everything is hidden between hills and olive trees, behind the chipped stones of a railway trestle, behind the rusted iron of a gate. The mas sprawls, it has become part of the landscape, despite the spear-pointed fence, or the crumbling mouth of an outdoor bread oven. Gaëtane asks us to watch for snails as we cross through the yard. Our eyes focus \- they are three to a blade of grass, little gray shells dotting the brambles under our feet. We tiptoe through the weeds.   

Inside the heavy wooden door, light trickles through tall, narrow windows. The walls are laced with spiderwebs and dust. Extension cords hang from the ceiling, coming together through hooks, fanning back out into the light fixtures. The steps are each worn into smooth valleys from five hundred years of footfalls – Gaëtane’s small feet, her mother’s. I imagine Michael, who I never met, climbing the stairs to his crowded bedroom, or higher, to the dovecote, now taken over by wasps, their nests lining the eaves, their hum filling the air.<span class="aside">[A8: Oct 7 ‘71 Fiona to Gran]({{'/objects/18_Jan_17_72_Fiona_to_Gran.pdf' | relative_url }}){:target='blank'}: I have had a very nasty summer and much trouble with Michael who can’t seem to decide what he wants to do. He went off to London two weeks ago to get a job; he wears his hair long and looks like a hippie and of course nobody is going to give him a job… He drives me frantic with his guitar-playing, but I think that his brain is a little altered from taking L.S.D. and it’s bad for him to be alone in London.</span> Up there, pigeonholes look out over the hills, over the highway to Aramon.

*Oh, Mother thinks its artistic this way, like a Frank Lloyd Wright house. Don’t you love the overgrown Louisiana Bayou look.*

The first time I saw Fiona’s house, I was thirteen. She insisted on meeting us at the gate. When my mother asked to see inside, she refused. The house is a mess, I think she said, or, we’re in a hurry.  

Fiona’s house reminds me of my grandmother’s, though it is 450 years older, and on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Both sisters have since died – Fiona outlived my grandmother by five years – and both left behind houses full of dust, old magazines, broken things and cat shit.  

At my grandmother’s house, the basement was always full of cat shit. They started going down there once their litter boxes were full, and their litter boxes stayed full for quite some time. The junk room was piled up to the windows with boxes of jam, which had stopped selling long before the business folded, but would keep for years to come. Every morning when the Gazette arrived, my grandmother would cut out the crossword and file it into a shoebox for later. These boxes lined the dining room walls; she finished only two a week, with my uncle’s help.  

When my grandmother was still driving, she used to sway between highway lanes, always taking the shortest path around the curves to save gas. She wrote down gas prices on a flip pad that she stored in the console of her minivan, always recording how much she had spent, at what cost per liter. She ate food long after it went bad \- my mother speculated that her taste buds had stopped working before I was born. We did all we could to avoid her cooking. She would serve moldy casserole, stale bread, frostbitten vegetables, limp greens. I once saw her drop an egg on the floor, bend over, and scoop it back into the shell before dropping it into her frying pan. 

Dot, her mother, had been a millionaire.

I can’t write about Gaëtane without writing about our family, and I can’t write about our family without thinking about Grey Gardens. In some ways, it’s an unfair comparison, although perhaps if Little Edie had had children, they would have been grounded and capable, as both my mother and Gaëtane grew up to be. But there is no question that ours is a family that has subsisted on delusions of grandeur.  

The origin of this grandeur is real. A real estate empire, a sugar refinery, a senate appointment and a knighthood preceded Dot and her children. But by Dot’s generation, the money that remained was in trust, no longer accumulating, but funding a privileged life for Dot, and a sheltered one for her children. We are a family in decline, my uncle once said to me, and measured in wealth and social standing, he is right.  

While she didn’t need to work, Dot spent her life studying, earning a bachelor’s degree the same year as her eldest daughter, then a master’s in French literature. She audited medical courses at Dartmouth, despite the school not admitting women as medical students until many years later. Once her children left home, she took over the management of St Margaret’s Home for the Incurables, established, in part by her own grandfather, in the late 19th century.<span class="aside">Some [doctors] optimistically asserted that they were easily cured; others saw them as all but inherently incurable, the product of an irreversible and inexorably fatal constitutional ﬂaw.<br><br>

My mother just calls it St. Margaret’s Home. The word *incurable* had long been removed from the name.<span class="aside">“What is meant by Incurable? A disease called incurable in one generation, is curable in the next. A disease incurable by one man, is curable by another. A disease called curable, ends in a painful death; a disease called incurable, is borne with little suffering through a long life, and after all is not the cause of death”.<br><br>

It had fallen out of common use, too absolute to contain hope for the future of anyone saddled with such a bleak diagnosis. The word was replaced by more specific language denoting chronic illness and palliative care, accounting for an increasingly precise medical landscape.  

{% include feature/image.html objectid="gae094" %}

The facility, which was by Dot’s era a home for women alone, was administered by the Sisterhood of Saint Margaret, and Dot was the president of the board.  In her position, she introduced a medical advisor for the residents, as well as a regular physician, Dr. Bayne, who was a pioneer of geriatric medicine in Canada.  She modernized the building, arranged for the installation of an elevator, the construction of a proper kitchen and dining room.   

The Sisterhood of Saint Margaret, a nursing order, solicited funds for the home, employed the floor staff, and tended to the residents spiritual needs. Over the years, the nuns faded into the background, until the home was secularized in 1975\.  A picture of the interior of the facility from 1933 shows them standing in the corners, heads bowed, faces shielded by their habits.  To me, they seem sinister, although they are in good company; each resident stares into the camera, unsmiling.  

The term *incurable,* in its day, had often been conflated with a sense of morality. An incurable was at once medically and morally so. While St Margaret’s Home was more assisted living facility than hospital, so too was it a product of the philosophies of its time<span class="aside">Of the era, medical historian Jason Szabo writes: “As the [19th] century progressed, doctors increasingly concurred that some combination of nature and nurture generated a fatal ﬂaw in the chronically ill.”</span>, charged with the care of those who were excluded, by reason of poverty or medical need, from other facilities or from the possibility of living independently.  Poverty and disability are, even today, too often disparaged as the result of personal failures, of weak-wills and defeatism. I have to imagine that these judgements, too, crept into the ethos of St Margaret’s Home, although to what degree, I can’t say.  

I can see myself casting about for a narrative here.  I want a sense of my great-grandmother, of her motivations and beliefs.  The Dot my mother remembers was fastidious, scientifically-minded, and emotionally distant. Her grandmother was a doctor, her grandfather, a baptist minister, and the two vocations seemed to have shaped her equally. She had a rigid sense of propriety, clear on the roles of men and women, despite her own, arguably radical medical interests. Her service at St Margaret’s home was informed by a commitment to medical advancements, and a commitment to religious service.  I can only speculate from here: Did this idea of the incurable, the morally compromised, shape her scientific curiosity? Did her commitment to science contradict, or complement her religious conviction?

*You know, people are very, very sensitive. No one takes into account how sensitive a person really is… Everybody is terribly sensitive. And other people don’t understand how sensitive a human being is. They don’t understand it. So they run roughshod over everybody.*

There is a painting in the family of Dot’s oldest three children, in winter coats, toques and mittens, in the snow.  They look serene, my grandmother’s arms are around her sister and brother, looking every bit the attentive eldest.  If we can assume love in a family, I see it there, in that painting, perhaps even in the fact of that painting, which my great-grandmother commissioned, as something to mark this moment in her children’s lives, something concrete that she could offer them, in place of a tenderness that challenged, maybe evaded her. They look like ghost children, the three of them, emerging in soft colors, an indistinct forest in the background.  

The painting is by Charles de Belle, a Hungarian-Canadian painter who gravitated toward portraits of children, looking serious, pink-cheeked and wispy.  In the family, there is a later portrait of my grandmother alone, and another of Dot’s home, red-roofed, on the bank of the St-Laurent. This evidence of privilege is sprinkled throughout our family homes \- paintings, furs, silverware.  What it amounts to is unclear \- my aunt, married into the family, calls us secret aristocrats, with some sarcasm.  On the phone, my uncle tells me: *It was unrealistic, it wasn’t anchored in reality, we were able to perpetuate this fantasy that we were the Kennedys.*  

I don’t agree, that it was a fantasy. Maybe our influence was inflated, but often privilege belongs to those who are perceived to have it, and who perceive themselves to deserve it. We had it in spades – we looked the part; we felt the part – regardless of the particulars of our circumstances. My grandmother sold jams at craft fairs from her minivan, raised chinchillas for fur in her basement, hounded us to buy into her multi-level marketing schemes, her house full of old papers, empty bottles and cat shit. Yet there was something she imparted, a fantasy of our worth, that was not so easily spent as Dot’s fortune.

It feels insensitive to consider the ways that this privilege may have hurt us. By all accounts, it embarrassed Dot, who drove a sensible car while her sister drove a Jaguar. But her shame about money, or maybe a societal precedent that permits the privileged to look away demurely when identified, seemed only to obscure reality for her daughters. who moved through life with the sense that there was an endless source of money somewhere, if only they could find their way to it.  Dot herself, while capable in many ways, left the finances to the men in her life, her father, then husband, then, after their divorce, the bankers.  Her three daughters, perhaps, learned from her that money was not theirs to understand.    

In the painting, the siblings look more unified than I ever remember. During my lifetime, they all lived thousands of kilometers apart; Huntley moved to Texas, all but cut himself off from the family. Nell moved out West, tended to people’s horses, Fiona moved to France and married an artist. I wonder if they corresponded with one another, or if they kept up through their children. When Nell died, my grandmother didn’t remember ever having known her very well.

*But you see in dealing with me, the relatives didn't know that they were dealing with a staunch character and I tell you if there's anything worse than dealing with a staunch woman... S-T-A-U-N-C-H. There's nothing worse, I'm telling you. They don't weaken, no matter what.*

*Dear Mummy, I haven’t written to you for so long because I’ve been absolutely seething about this whole business.  Your last letter is full of the advice that people have been giving and I know that you always need somebody to tell you what to do so I’ll tell you what I think.*

- Fiona Millar, 1971<span class="aside">"I don't blame them, I don't blame them. Even my mother... I don't, I don't have any... Any bitterness or resentment towards my mother. My mother, she did what she could, within the limits of what she had."</span>

Gaëtane does not speak ill of her mother.  She tells me about her childhood in a kind of passive voice, that she had gone to this school, then that one, that even while she acted out in hopes of being home again, she ended up here and there, boarded with a woman in Aramon, a Steiner school in England, a lycée in Montpellier, living with Nell in Canada. As she tells me her stories, she seems self-effacing – she laughs at her antics, at the way her childhood was marked by a cycle of exile and return.
