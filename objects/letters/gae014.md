Dear Mrs. Millar:  

In response to your letter of November 3, we can appreciate your concern about Gaetane.  She has written letters to staff members here also which would indicate that she is in a very confused situation, to say the least.  Dr. Fort, out Clinical Director, states that the Lodge would be willing to have her back but we understand that she does not want to come back and this might make the situation quite difficult if she is, in fact, legally married.  We would imagine a court procedure would be required.  Whether or not  her husband would cooperate would be a major issue unless, of course, the conditions were such that an annulment of the marriage could also be arranged.    

Treatment might be difficult if Gaetane bitterly opposed it but we would be willing to try.  If you wish to pursue this further, I would imagine you would need to consider, with your lawyer, what steps might be taken.  

Sincerely yours,  
Mrs. Helene Mayock  
Psychiatric Social Worker
