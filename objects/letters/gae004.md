"Please send Gaëtane’s passport to ℅ Mrs. Hunt 5858 \- 152 St Surrey BC.

Dear Gaëtane’s grandmere,  
	Gaëtane is not a very good letter-answerer so I have decided to answer your questions, being her very closest friend and living with her here in our beautiful commune by the lake up in the wild woods of BC \- the man she married is a wonderful fine man, he has some business in Vancouver and is coming (cumming) up to join us soon.  He has 2 years university \- tho it means nothing as this is the dawning of the age of aquarius and we have (everybody, especially youth) realized that mankind’s salvation lies in his kicking over the traves, getting out of the unreal cruel walls of modern cities and conventions, and getting abc to the land and nature’s ways, as we are meant to live \- wild and free \- in other words \- turn on \- tune in \- drop out \-  
	Because the world is round it turns me on  
	Because the wind is high it blows my mind  
	Because the sky is blue it makes me cry  
So we are trying to live together off the land as much as we can \- we are moving and building a log cabin and getting goats and chickens and peacocks and we have horses and dogs and cats and babies and we are very happy or striving to be \- at least Gaëtane and Peter and I are very happy with what we are doing \- we have used some of the money you sent for oil paints and canvas ad are getting into painting in a beautiful way.  Gaëtane and I paint well together \- we will send you some pictures if you think you might like them \- but \- more about Peter you might like to hear \- I lost your letter so I can’t remember what want to know \- but I’m making some bread and Roland is playing his guitar and singing and Gaëtane is falling asleep in the corner and its 3 in the morning and we’re all okay and fine \- we aren’t perfect by a long shot but we’re getting there and we can see the road clear ahead of us and also your road and everybodies and I hope you’re happy.  If you aren’t why don’t you come and live with us or visit anyway \- it would be very good \- anyway Peter doesn’t need a job as we are living off the land as in days gone by \- and marriages are rather harried in this day (him not being here yet and all) but it was love almost at 1st sight I’d say \- Yours truly,  
					Rosie  
(She really does love you (and everyone) she probably loves you more than anyone else you know) I think we’re going to France soon.)  
Please write again if there’s anything else you want to know and I’ll try not to lose it this time.  Gaëtane sends her love xxx"
