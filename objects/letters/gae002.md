"Dear Mrs. Millar,  
	I would like to dispel any worries you may have over the disappearance of Gaëtane.  She will remain with me in hiding until our marriage takes place.  At that time I will become her legal guardian and it is not my intention to permit her to return to Chestnut Lodge.  Regretfully, I cannot sign my name until we feel free from pursuit.  
	**But I’ll sign mine,**  
			Gaëtane"
