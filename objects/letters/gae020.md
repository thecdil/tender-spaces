"Dear Mr Fetherstonhaugh,  
	Iâ€™m sorry that after the efforts you made towards getting my divorce through as quickly and simply as possible, I will not be able to attend.  
	As you tell me it is not possible to divorce me without my being there, we should try to consider other alternatives.  One would be to have Peter take the initiative.  As it could still be done on the grounds of a three-year separation, it would cause no embarrassment on any ones part.  If Peter would consent to this, it may yet be the best way of obtaining this divorce.  The other alternatives are for me to come at some future date, or to divorce me from France.  They both may present considerable difficulty, the first as I cannot afford to take the time off school, the second, for obvious reasons. You may be able to come up with other alternatives, if so, please do not hesitate to write.  
	Please accept my thanks, and my apologies as to the suddenness of my leave.  
Yours truly,  
	G Pratchett"
