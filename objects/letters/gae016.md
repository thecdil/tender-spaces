"Dear Grandmother,  
	I wish you a very good Christmas.  I have a present for you, but it will not get to you until your birthday.  It is well worth waiting for.  Things have been in a state of change for me these days.  Sometimes things are good, sometimes not.  My eyes are still not right, so I’m taking vitamins and going to see the eye doctor next week.  
	It is snowing tonight for the 1st time this year.  There is snow all over the ground and it’s really quiet and beautiful.  
	Have you heard from mother?  Since she wrote me that perfectly horrible letter, I haven’t heard from her. **Maybe she needs somebody to feel hostile towards.  I wish she’d pick somebody else.**   
	I am getting along quite well with the people here.  If I felt just a little better, I could improve on things a lot.  But I suppose time will solve things and I believe in my strength(?).  
	Please give my love to Dora and Papples(?).  I think I’ll go to bed, it’s late.  
Much love,  
	Gaëtane
