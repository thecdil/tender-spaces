Dear Mrs. Buttigieg:

This is to let you know that we officially discharged Gaetane, against medical advice, on June 30, 1971. I know that Mrs. Hyde has been in touch with you regarding the events of the past month. We are indeed sorry that Gaetane chose to leave before her treatment was completed as we all saw her as a young lady with a good deal of potential.

We do hope that some of the progress she made here will stand her in good stead.

Sincerely yours,

(Mrs.) Helene Mayock
Psychiatric Social Worker
