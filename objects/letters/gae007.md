"Dear Grandmother,  
	We have found our land after some search.  136 acres fo 14,500$.  It has 1 cabin and a barn on it, and the land next door can be rented for 160$/year – it has quite a lot of buildings.  
	There is about 6 ft of snow in the winter but the plough goes right up to our property.  
	What I think we should do to earn the money is arts and crafts.  Rosa is painting fantastic pictures.  Gary (?) (Mary’s boyfriend) does carpentry, and I can do just about anything.  I was thinking that especially Christmas we would have a pretty good market.   
	Everybody else is really pessimistic and saying things like we can’t live in it for 2 years.  What do you think of my idea?  
	We are still at the Hunt’s.  Give my love to Nell and Dora.  
		Love,  
			Gaëtane"
