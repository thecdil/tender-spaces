Please Grandmother, I need a farm to live on and call my home, with some land and a garden and some chickens, and an orchard, a few goats maybe.   

I would live there with Peter and my friends Rosamunde and Mary and we would store food for the winter.  We are already canning blueberries and blackberries.  We would can salmon too and hunt in the hunting season so we would be easily self-supportive.  We would get goats milk and eggs too.  We might keep rabbits, they are very good to eat, but I hate to lock animals up in little cages so we wouldn’t unless we have a big pen.  And we’d have a stream on the property, or a spring, and every day we would go fetch water there and swim in it in the morning and our head would just feel so clean.  And we would have a root cellar where to store the produce of our garden and a room full of canned goods that we canned ourselves.  And we would get a whole bunch of wax and make lots of candles because we wouldn’t have power of course.  And in the summer time we would hay and store our hay in the barn which would be waterproof of course so that when the horses came down from Prince George we would have hay (Mary is the horse girl from the free school, you know?).  

And we would have 2 or 3 rooms to create in for pottery and painting and leather work and carving and all those things which are so good to do.  

Please Grandmother, I know it would cost a lot, but buy me a farm.
