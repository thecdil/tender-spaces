Dear Gaetane:

Re: Dame Gaetane Lesley Buttigieg \-vs-  
Peter William Paul Pratchett  
Superior Court Montreal 500-12-050149-750

We attended at Court yesterday and filed the document; and now must wait approximately 90 days after which time we will again attend at court and file document asking for your Divorce to be confirmed, trusting there will be no dispute from Mr. Pratchett.

In the meantime, we will keep you advised and will send you a certified court copy of your judgment of divorce when it is available.

Yours truly,  
John Fetherstonhaugh  
Encls.  
C.c. Mrs M. D. Millar  
P.s. Could you send me a cheque to cover the Vancouver account, either payable to the Undersigned or directly to Farris Vaughan Wills & Murphy.  
Me. Poole is a first class man and has, I think, taken a personal interest in straightening out this matter."
