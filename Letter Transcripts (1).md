Dear Mrs. Millar,  
	I would like to dispel any worries you may have over the disappearance of Gaëtane.  She will remain with me in hiding until our marriage takes place.  At that time I will become her legal guardian and it is not my intention to permit her to return to Chestnut Lodge.  Regretfully, I cannot sign my name until we feel free from pursuit.  
	**But I’ll sign mine,**  
			Gaëtane

**gae004**

Please send Gaëtane’s passport to ℅ Mrs. Hunt 5858 \- 152 St Surrey BC.

Dear Gaëtane’s grandmere,  
	Gaëtane is not a very good letter-answerer so I have decided to answer your questions, being her very closest friend and living with her here in our beautiful commune by the lake up in the wild woods of BC \- the man she married is a wonderful fine man, he has some business in Vancouver and is coming (cumming) up to join us soon.  He has 2 years university \- tho it means nothing as this is the dawning of the age of aquarius and we have (everybody, especially youth) realized that mankind’s salvation lies in his kicking over the traves, getting out of the unreal cruel walls of modern cities and conventions, and getting abc to the land and nature’s ways, as we are meant to live \- wild and free \- in other words \- turn on \- tune in \- drop out \-  
	Because the world is round it turns me on  
	Because the wind is high it blows my mind  
	Because the sky is blue it makes me cry  
So we are trying to live together off the land as much as we can \- we are moving and building a log cabin and getting goats and chickens and peacocks and we have horses and dogs and cats and babies and we are very happy or striving to be \- at least Gaëtane and Peter and I are very happy with what we are doing \- we have used some of the money you sent for oil paints and canvas ad are getting into painting in a beautiful way.  Gaëtane and I paint well together \- we will send you some pictures if you think you might like them \- but \- more about Peter you might like to hear \- I lost your letter so I can’t remember what want to know \- but I’m making some bread and Roland is playing his guitar and singing and Gaëtane is falling asleep in the corner and its 3 in the morning and we’re all okay and fine \- we aren’t perfect by a long shot but we’re getting there and we can see the road clear ahead of us and also your road and everybodies and I hope you’re happy.  If you aren’t why don’t you come and live with us or visit anyway \- it would be very good \- anyway Peter doesn’t need a job as we are living off the land as in days gone by \- and marriages are rather harried in this day (him not being here yet and all) but it was love almost at 1st sight I’d say \- Yours truly,  
					Rosie  
(She really does love you (and everyone) she probably loves you more than anyone else you know) I think we’re going to France soon.)  
Please write again if there’s anything else you want to know and I’ll try not to lose it this time.  Gaëtane sends her love xxx

**gae005** 

Dear Grandmother,

	I sort of noticed a certain coldness about your letter, as if you were mad about something.  If it is about me not writing, I have written an awful lot of letters which never got sent.  I’ll try to send this one, though.  Please tell me what it is though.  
	I would like to know what your expectations of me are and what you are going to do to me if I don’t live up to them.  The other night, I was hitchhiking peacefully with my friends, when the police grabbed me and threw me in a cell.  It is apparently because of a warrant Nell put out.  I wonder how she would enjoy spending a night in a cell.  I hope the warrant is now off.  
	We are looking for a home, Rosamunde, Peter, Mary and me each in **our own little house.**  Prince George isn’t it.  I haven’t seen Mary since I came back when Rosamunde and me came up she had just left.  Peter is God knows where too.  I forgot to get his address when I left and couldn’t see him in time to tell him, so I phoned and somebody said they’d give him the message, but if he knew I was here, he would I know have written or come or something.  The next time I go into Vancouver I guess I’ll see him.  But I sure wish he and Mary were here now.  
	I have not seen Wendy, maybe when you write, you could give me their address.  I couldn’t find it in the phone book.  
	**I also would like to know how much you are willing to give me if I give you nothing but a thankful heart in return.  And probably not even write to tell you about it.**  
Much love,  
	jittoKV  
P.s. My best friend of friends Kanzan respectably acknowledges your thanks for her letter but wishes you had answered her personally.

Dear Gaëtane,  
I was happy to receive your letter with its accounts of your feelings and activities.  
1\. **What do I expect of you?  You are no longer a child and you must work out for yourself what you most want your future life to be.  Whatever you decide will not make me love you any less.**  I may think that some of the things you do are not \_\_\_\_\_ but this will not alter my affection for you.  We all make mistakes and as long as we learn from them that is the main thing.  There are always ups and downs in life but if you can work out an adult life which will, on balance, satisfy your needs and aspirations & prove productive in the direction most suited to your brains and abilities and imaginative gifts (artistically, for instance,) nothing will please me more than for you to find happiness in your life.  
I think we all need to go back to nature sometimes.  I am at Ivry for a few days with Dora and Huntly.  It is overcast & rainy but still beautiful & restful.  Jack’s father died & we attended his funeral on Wed. It was a blessed release as he had been ill for a long time.  
	Wendy is looking for a new apt so the best way to contact her at the moment is through her in-laws.

	**I am sorry to hear of your being picked up by the police, but naturally when you vanished from Chestnut Lodge the police were notified and perhaps the ones who picked you up were not able to check until the next day that you were married.**  
	By the way the Royal Trust received from Chestnut Lodge one or two notices or cheques in refund of books you had ordered.  I gave them your address (at the commune) and asked them to send them to you.  Did you receive them?  
	Nell is taking Lorne to a school in Texas next week & Martin will soon be gone back to England.  Did I tell you that Olivia sent me a very nice photo of herself & a mischievous looking picture of Stephen?

**gae006** 

	Please Grandmother, I need a farm to live on and call my home, with some land and a garden and some chickens, and an orchard, a few goats maybe.   
	I would live there with Peter and my friends Rosamunde and Mary and we would store food for the winter.  We are already canning blueberries and blackberries.  We would can salmon too and hunt in the hunting season so we would be easily self-supportive.  We would get goats milk and eggs too.  We might keep rabbits, they are very good to eat, but I hate to lock animals up in little cages so we wouldn’t unless we have a big pen.  And we’d have a stream on the property, or a spring, and every day we would go fetch water there and swim in it in the morning and our head would just feel so clean.  And we would have a root cellar where to store the produce of our garden and a room full of canned goods that we canned ourselves.  And we would get a whole bunch of wax and make lots of candles because we wouldn’t have power of course.  And in the summer time we would hay and store our hay in the barn which would be waterproof of course so that when the horses came down from Prince George we would have hay (Mary is the horse girl from the free school, you know?).  
	And we would have 2 or 3 rooms to create in for pottery and painting and leather work and carving and all those things which are so good to do.  
	**Please Grandmother, I know it would cost a lot, but buy me a farm.**  
									Gaëtane

**gae007** 

Dear Grandmother,  
	We have found our land after some search.  136 acres fo 14,500$.  It has 1 cabin and a barn on it, and the land next door can be rented for 160$/year – it has quite a lot of buildings.  
	There is about 6 ft of snow in the winter but the plough goes right up to our property.  
	What I think we should do to earn the money is arts and crafts.  Rosa is painting fantastic pictures.  Gary (?) (Mary’s boyfriend) does carpentry, and I can do just about anything.  I was thinking that especially Christmas we would have a pretty good market.   
	Everybody else is really pessimistic and saying things like we can’t live in it for 2 years.  What do you think of my idea?  
	We are still at the Hunt’s.  Give my love to Nell and Dora.  
		Love,  
			Gaëtane

Friday Oct 1st, Surrey  
Dear Grandmother,  
	I am dead tired after getting back from a day’s hard work at the potato farm which is all I have been able to find.  The pay is horrible.  I have earned 4$ today working as hard as I could.  Mary had a 2 week babysitting job but at this rate, I doubt we could ever pay you back.  So I have another deal to make with you and mother.  
	Would you buy the farm in her name as an investment which she could sell in a few years at a good profit?  Mother would have to agree too of course but you could leave it to her as an inheritance thing now before dec anyway and get rid of at least part of the capitals gains tax (there would still be some when she sells the place) and also make a profit on it.  
	I would care take it for her and as rent pay the tax however much it is.  You see, I want to paint and make and create things.  The only job that I would get any pleasure doing and which is within my means, is that.  But I could never earn enough money that way to pay for a farm.  
	I want you to know that I am not just being impossible or whatever.  I am trying hard to organize my life in a workable way.  Part of it is that I don’t feel ready to own a farm but would sure like to live on.  On land anyway.  
	Also I am not sure how permanent I am: that I want to live in B.C. for ever and ever but I would like to travel and have a place to go back to.  
	We thought we had found the place but hadn’t.  Right now we are investigating a 200 acre farm for 25,000 60 cleared near very hot Cache Creek with lots of water.  It has a house, a creek and 2 cabins.  
	**Also, do you think you could send me an allowance?  35$/month maybe for food, paints and I have a doctors bill this month.  I gashed my arm quite badly on some glass.  If I needed anything else I’ll just earn it.**    
	I think that’s all I have on my list of things to tell you.   
	If you see Nell ask her to forward my stuff from Maryland.  
Much love,  
	Gaëtane

**gae009**

This was written a few days ago & I wanted to retype it but I guess it’s alright as it stands.  
**Dear Mummy,**  
	**I haven’t written to you for so long because I’ve been absolutely seething about this whole business.  Your last letter is full of the advice that people have been giving and I know that you always need somebody to tell you what to do so I’ll tell you what I think.**

1. **You should be very annoyed with Gaëtane, because you went to a great deal and trouble and expense to maintain her in Chestnut Lodge; and firstly she should not have left and secondly you have every right to be annoyed by the way she went about leaving, and thirdly Gaëtane should have been made to realize that, having broken parole, as it were, she probably made things very difficult for the ones she left behind her as the regulations may well have been probably changed because of her.**  
2. You had no business sending 250 dollars to Gaëtane when I particularly asked that no money be sent under the circumstances; and as you did send it I think that you should have notified me at once that you were sending it and why and what the lawyer had said; instead of the very hedgy letter I did get from you about Gaëtane and her marriage.  
3. This marriage of Gaëtane’s is not to be taken seriously, and I think that at least you ought to have seen Gaëtane first without her husband to try to get some insight into the situation.  **Peter Pratchett is some sort of a nothing whom Gaëtane is using to prevent her return to Chestnut Lodge**, and from our point of view he is behaving very badly.  He had no business marrying Gaëtane if he was not prepared to support her and no business abetting her departure from Chestnut Lodge without consulting her doctor and her family beforehand.  Peter Pratchett would have to go a very long way to get any approval from me.  
4. As Gaëtane has left Chestnut Lodge, she should now take her responsibilities upon her own shoulders, and not be expecting to have farms bought for her and allowances paid to her.  If she can’t get a job or settle down to an acceptable way of life, or pursue her studies, then her doctor is right and she should be in a place like Chestnut Lodge having psychiatric care; if she were able to fend for herself then I would say that the year she had there was sufficient.  But she has made no show of even trying to get a job, and she expects money to be provided to keep both herself and Rosie.  And of course you in your eagerness to help fall right into the trap.  Cathie, Gaëtane’s Aramon friend who comes riding with me says “Je crois que cette Rosie lui donne de mauvais conseils.”  I agree.  The nail on the head.  I have absolutely no sympathy for that Rosie, who, if one is to judge from the letters she’s written to me and Paul is a candidate for the Looney bin, and I think that it is essential for Gaëtane that we remove her from her sphere of influence.  Instead of which, you propose to set them up with a farm towards which you will pay $14,000 which they are to reimburse at $5 a month.  As Gaëtane says in her letter to me “**Grandmère nous prête de l’argent pour une ferme, $14000, je ne sais pas comment on lui le payera.  Si on achète mes peintures et celles de Rosamonde ça ira et on fera des crafts aussi mais je préfère mourir de faim que de faire semblant d’être autre chose que ce je suis alors je ne sais pas.**  Je ne m’inquiète pas trop.  C’est choses sont “beyond my understanding.

.

1. Gaëtane is already vague about it.  
2. In the same way that when you sent her money to buy a horse, she chose a horse which was incurably lame, she will choose a farm which can never be profitable; all G. now wants to do is paint.  I imagine that Rosie wants the farm.  
3. As far as running a commune is concerned, Gaëtane is a genius at getting people quarreling who would otherwise get along.  When I hear all about the school being divided into two camps, I can imagine that Gaëtane was one of the chief instigators of the scission.

Tom Durrie is the last person I would listen to; and I certainly think that you should have seen Rosie and the Hunts.  I imagine that he was trying to protect his own reputation.  The Hunts were no doubt offended that you did not see them, and as for Rosie, if you are planning to set her up on a farm you could at least have had a word with her.  **Gaëtane has been telling all these people how rich her grandmother is and how much it cost at Chestnut Lodge,** and they are all pushing G, to get as much as she can out of you.  The answer to that one is that you made the money available as it was essential that she get good care in happy surroundings; as she is now refusing that care the money will now be used to set up a Trust fund for Lorne who will be an invalid all his life.

- A maximum allowance of $25… Not enough to live on.  
- If you are to lend the money for a farm you want to be certain that she can run it; you must expect her to have a degree in Agriculture and a year’s experience as paid labour on a farm.

It’s not fair, Mummy, to buy her a farm at this stage; she won’t be able to live on it all by herself and she’ll be almost forced to stay with that Rosie, who may or may not take drugs but seems to be in a chronically abnormal state.  It’s too great a responsibility and it will be too great a failure for her to cope with.  When I was her age I’d had a year of agriculture and knew I didn’t want a farm; and Gaëtane is much too sentimental about animals to make a profit raising them.

- That you would reconsider the question of allowance if Gaëtane were doing some serious studying or going to University.

	I have written Gaëtane asking her if she wishes to have her marriage annulled, in which case I intend to do that.  In her letter, which is mostly taken up with a very unGaëtanelike request for money to buy painting materials, as all she wants to do is paint… I don’t see why I should send her money for painting materials for her and Rosie when she had all of that provided at Chestnut Lodge and she didn’t even take the trouble to take lessons… She mentions her husband… Mon mari a toujours beaucoup à apprendre.  Je ne crois pas qu’on retournera ensemble pour quelque temps en tout cas.  Gaëtane is so attached to the people she likes that she can’t keep away from them; she is certainly not planning her future with Peter.  
	I have written to ask Gaëtane if she can come here to the mas as I have had a nasty fall and I am in very great pain.  
	I have had a very nasty summer and much trouble with Michael who can’t seem to decide what he wants to do.  He went off to London two weeks ago to get a job; he wears his hair long and looks like a hippie and of course nobody is going to give him a job… He got one washing dishes in a French restaurant from 4pm till 8 at night but then lost it because he overslept(\!)  Anyway I’ve had three calls for Money and I can’t go on supporting him in London so I’ve told him to come back and do the vendages here.  He drives me frantic with his guitar-playing, but I think that his brain is a little altered from taking L.S.D. and it’s bad for him to be alone in London.  
	Now there’s something I really must ask you.  Is there to be any change in the Children’s trusts, or will the money come through normally in January as usual?  I need to know this, because I have a final payment to make on the flats in Spain.  
	The second thing I want to ask you is: Can you lend me 10,000 dollars until I have sold the flat in Paris.  I was hoping to attend to this last June, moving out and putting it up for sale, I mean, but then I had all that trouble with Michael and brought him back with me, and as every minute he was threatening to go off and join his hippie friends in Amsterdam I thought it better to worry about the flat later.  And now I’ve had this accident and I can’t drive the car and Michael will be coming, and the first money-making (I hope) litter of Yorkshire Terriers is due in six weeks and heaven knows when I’ll be able to go and pack up my stuff and move or when it will be sold.  In the meantime the mortgage on the mas has been unexpectedly not renewed, as the lender has died; which means that I’ll have to pay 6,000 dollars on very short notice.  I did not want to use the children’s trust money for the mas, as it would be too difficult to make it available to them…  I could try to get another loan, but that means ten percent lost for the notary; and if I did not have the interest to pay it would mean fifty dollars more a month, which I could use.  The other four thousand dollars would be to buy a comfortable family car (I am thinking of the new Volkswagen) which I could use for the long distances I travel which would mean greater safety and comfort for my aching back than the Renault Van.  I would keep the Renault for the carrying jobs around the mas, as the turn-in value is very low, and I hope that it would be an incentive for Michael to learn to drive & would help him gain confidence in himself; I’ve been trying to persuade him for two years now.  
	Also I have written to Gaëtane saying would she come if I sent her a return ticket to help me at the mas until I get over my accident.  I did not know at this time that Michael would be coming.  If she says yes then I’ll have to have some money to buy the ticket, and I used up the money I had in the bank in Montreal with all the expenses of this summer.  My monthly allowance goes in about a week when there are several people to feed, as buying power has diminished so.  (However I’m not complaining it is just that it is so nerve-wracking having money worries and I hope that I will make something with my dogs (Yorkie puppies are worth $200 each in France… But of course they’ve not hatched yet\!)  
	If there is anything left over I have some very urgent things to have done at the mas…a hot water heater… I wish you could have seen me after the fall struggling up to the bathroom with kettles of boiling water so that I could have a good soak……A gate and bars for the windows and locks etc… a ditch behind the house so that the water doesn’t seep in when it rains… All these are things that I could attend to now, curtains to help keep the wind out.  All the pipes repaired  there are buckets everywhere for the drips\!  
7 Oct. 1971  
Dear Mummy;   
	I got up in the middle of the night several nights ago and banged out several pages to you… Since then they’ve just been sitting here and I’ve been putting off correcting them and retyping them.  Since then I’ve received your letter enclosing Gaëtane’s and the lawyer’s letters.  Michael was due to arrive on Tuesday and was to have started his harvesting Wednesday, so that when the phone rang at 4.30 this morning and I dashed down in my bare feet, I was sure it must be he.  However it was Gaëtane… a collect call.  All about a farm for which she had to give an answer this very day… The more she went on about it the more I was against it… I thought that her answers were so childish and immature that finally I asked her if she had been taking drugs.  She said some “kif” and once L.S.D. at the hospital and when she got out.  I asked if Rosie was taking drugs and she said not any more.  **I said Well, to judge from the letter she wrote she must be quite mad, and she said yes, she is.**  I gather that the farm is to house the four of them…Mary and her boyfriend and Rosie and Gaëtane and between them they all know how to farm; and the Hunt parents will be glad to get rid of them because they don’t do anything at home and cost a lot of money.  (Nell and I decided a long time ago that we thought that Mrs. Hunt was a rather grasping woman.)  So that now that you’ve spent a fortune getting Gaëtane away from these Hunts, you’re going to spend another fortune keeping them all together again, and there’ll be no end to the begging letters you’ll be receiving.  Gaëtane said that after all you had been spending 2,700 dollars a month for Chestnut Lodge, so that you could just as well buy her a farm.  I said that I had been against that, that I thought she might just as well have gone to Verdun, but that Nell had persuaded me, saying that she thought you would be ready to spend the money for any one of us who needed it.  I said that now that she was not at Chestnut Lodge I was going to suggest to you that the money be used to set up a Trust Fund for Lorne, who might never be able to be self-supporting.  
	**Gaëtane at one point said : “Mais je suis folle, je ne sais que je suis folle\!”  I said that in that case she had better be very careful because she might find herself shut up somewhere.**  
	I would now like you to write to Gaëtane and suggest the following ideas:-

1. That she has left Chestnut Lodge without her doctor’s accord, that the medical opinion is that she needed treatment and should have continued with it; and that as this treatment has been so frightfully expensive you have found it necessary to put money aside in case another emergency arises and it is necessary for her to complete her treatment.  
2. That you have spend far greater sums of money on her than on any of the other grandchildren, and that you want to use your money to help some of the others.  
3. That Gaëtane did not comply with the arrangements that you made for her at Chestnut Lodge, but went off without her doctor’s agreement.  You were not consulted beforehand and had no part in these arrangements, therefore it is now up to Peter Pratchett to provide for his wife or for Gaëtane to provide for herself.  
4. That when she had first asked you for a farm, you had liked the idea and wanted to help, thinking that it would provide a family home and livelihood for herself and Peter.  Since meeting Peter, you realise that he is not the farmer type, and that although you know that Gaëtane is a hard worker, her studies have never included such things as animal husbandry, agronomy, parasitology, marketing and accountancy.  
5. That agriculture has become more and more competitive with new and better methods coming in all the time, and that instead of buying her a farm at this time, when her marriage has got off to such a dubious start and may not last, you would far rather finance a course in agriculture studies (or in fact in any other studies, such as Beaux-Arts.)

We were in complete disaccord on the telephone… I was half asleep and couldn't think quickly, in fact I’ve been worrying myself sick about Michael’s not turning up and giving no sign of life, now I think about it, his passport needs renewing and he may not have had enough money, but he could have at least phoned.  
	I asked Gaëtane about her marriage, and she said that she had done that for the sole purpose of not returning to Chestnut Lodge.  I asked her if she wanted to arrange to have it annulled and she said no, because then we would send her back to Chestnut Lodge.  I told her that a divorce would cost two or three thousand dollars, and she said that we would see about that in a few years’ time.  
	**We must always bear in mind that Gaëtane thrives on adversity; if things are made too easy for her she does not cooperate or does something to upset everything.**  
	And we don’t owe the Hunts anything, in fact the more we can do to get Gaëtane away from Mary and Rosamond the better it will be.  So that if Gaëtane has to work for a living, it will help her to meet some other people.  She learned to sell in the shop at Chestnut Lodge.  Or she could go to work on a farm and find out what it’s really like.  But if she decides to study, she must do so seriously, because she has wasted enough time and money already, and she must give some proof of her attendance at courses.  
	**Gaëtane has firmly convinced herself that her grandmother is a millionaire, or it has been brought to her attention, but you must not forget that she is Paul’s daughter and you don’t want to turn her into a professional beggar.**  (When I told Paul that Gaëtane has asked you to buy a farm in B.C. he said That’s wonderful, we’ll all go there.)  
	Since the phone call, I have decided to ask you for a loan of only $2000, as I don’t want her to imagine that I am scrapping her farm in order to borrow the money myself.  One of the apartments in Spain will belong to her, but I see no need to inform her of that for the time being.  She seems to have no idea how much she has worried & upset everybody\!  Please keep me in touch with developments.

- Much love Fiona

P.s. I hope that you have recovered well from your car accident \- I still can’t sit down (don’t laugh) \- I’m sure something must have cracked\!  
P.p.s. G said she would not come to the mas as she did not have her passport.

Wed Oct 6th  
Dear Grandmother,  
	It seems to me that there are some pts in need of straightening out, some things which you are not quite clear on.  I will try to explain things clearly to you in this letter, but you will have to try and understand them.  
	One is why I left the hospital  
	Two is my marriage with Peter  
	Three is why I want a farm  
	Four is whether or not I am trying to abuse your generosity.  
	Five is what I want to do with my life and why.  
	All those things fit together.  They cannot really be separated one from the other but for simplicity's sake I have outlined them.  There is one thing that everything hinges on.  It is the religion which I mentioned before.

1. To understand why I left the hospital, you’ve got to see why I came to the hospital, from Nell’s point of view and from mine.

Nell’s: I went to jail for crawling on the streets having been kicked out from the free school 3 months since.  The day I got out of jail, I was put into an emergency ward for mushroom poisoning.  10 days later, I phoned Nell and told her I was not scared to die anymore.  In the meantime, my family has received letters from me which they can make neither head o tail of.  Also my year with Nell was pretty hectic.  
	So Nell figures I need psychiatric care and sets the wheels in motion.  
Mine: I have however an entirely different view of the picture.  When I got kicked out of the free school, I had only tried marijuana once and it had had no effect.  That evening, I tried L.S.D. which I have only had twice since and will never take again.  I was not very involved into drugs then and never have been or will be.  I do not feel that marijuana in moderation will do me harm and I feel that there are spiritual things which it may help me to understand, by stopping my conscious mind from blocking my unconscious from me.  It has helped a few times, but I will not even take that for a long time.  It would not be helpful.  
	As for crawling on the street, it was mainly an experiment.  People are always assuming to move around you should walk.  I will admit it is the easiest way but it would be narrowing your life to a great extent not to take every possibility or most and try them out.  Test the feel of it, the different view of the world from that vantage point, people’s reaction to a situation which they have never encountered before, if anything with seemingly nothing to do with the experience can be learned from it.  Also learning to express an opinion which other people will not even consider the possibility of sharing.  
	**There is no end to the number of things that crawling on the streets will teach a person\!**  
	The mushroom episode is one which has shown me the river I had to cross and helped me cross it.  That particular type of mushroom has been used by many civilizations to try and reach their particular version of God.  There are several books about it.  One called “the Sacred Mushroom and the Cross,” brings forward the idea that Christ used it, also the ancient Egyptians and the Mexicans still have ceremonies with that mushroom.    
They know more about it than me though, and I took a little too much.  Fortunately I had the sense to make myself vomit while I could.  
When that experience, beautiful and frightening as it was, was over and I was back into this world, I felt a very intense love for myself and the world.  Something completely unselfish.  I was able to see the forest and each individual tree and see the beauty of each and how they fitted perfectly to make a whole.  And how everything fitted, even man who likes to separate himself from nature, man who does not know he has no more or less right to use land than the smallest plant or bird or even rock.  Each one of us whatever race or kind has his place, and to a great extent, we are all a part of each other.  If you have had or do ever have the experience of looking into the beauty of somebody’s soul, you will or have seen the prints of the same maker.  
When I phoned Nell and told her I was no longer scared to die, I did not think of telling her that I was not scared to live either.  All my fear was completely gone.  Dissolved by the beauty which I saw all around me.  It was as if I had suddenly entered heaven.  2 weeks later I was in a hospital.  
After a while, I rather got to like the one in Montreal.  There were people there, willing to work on my level, one of absolute honesty, explanation of feelings and understanding of them on both parties.  The nurses and me actually went quite far into the removal of inhibitions to be replaced by trust of one another.  In spite of the fact that I only spent 2 months there I would still trust Vivian Turley, the head nurse, say, with my most inside of inside feelings.  
Then I went to Chestnut Lodge.  That place may have a good reputation and nice grounds, but that’s about all.  The people there, most of them, were very stuck in the dull routine of either being crazy or depressed or working 8 hrs/day, among crazy and depressed people.  For a while it was okay.  Then my resistance started wearing a little thin.  **The atmosphere of Chestnut Lodge is one of 50 years of despair.**  It gradually started seeping into me to sap my strength.  Especially Christmas.  It was horrible\!  As a matter of fact, I cant remember feeling quite right since, though things are beginning to look up.  
It’s true I might not have left if I hadn’t got a place to come to, but you musn’t blame the Hunts for helping me in my need.  I would not have left if I had felt it was in the least bit healthy for me to be there.  After a while, I had learned all I could from the place and it was of no further interest to me.  I had almost no communication with my doctor throughout that time, partly because of his inability to understand me, partly because I was tired of explaining things.  We started out on the wrong foot and things never got better.  
Peter and me were carrying on an irregular correspondence at that time and he told me in one of his letters “If you need a guardian, sponsor or anything, just write.”  So I wrote to him and we figured out that legally, the best thing would be to get me out of Nell’s custody altogether, which would involve marrying me.  So he did.  
**See, I think that if I ever wanted to marry somebody in a real forever bond, I would not need papers that say I have done it.  Correspondingly, those papers have for me lost their old value, but they are not entirely worthless, they are worth my freedom.  I would probably be into some other hospital by now if I hadn’t got married.  I’m through with that kind of place.  They know too little for me to put my soul in their hands.**  
**Incidentally, I asked my doctor, Nell and mom a repeated amount of times to let me go.  They wouldn’t.  If it had been less important, I would have just forgotten about it.  But that I continue learning about life and how to help people is the most important thing in my life.  It is my life.  Without it, I am not.  The hospital was hindering that knowledge.**  
See my “religion” has so much to do with spontaneous feelings and their expression until selfishness, fear, jealousy, all those things, are of the distant past, that I could not do it while working 8 hrs a day.  In fact that would quite impede it.  Say I suddenly want to stand on my head, hug somebody, run in the rain naked, I would be very limited in the city environment.  That is why I want a farm.  I want to be able to go out naked on a full moon night and dance and sing and howl without having to think “Am I waking anyone up?  Will the police suddenly appear?”  It only makes things more difficult than they already are.  
I know too, that what I am looking for, not only for myself, but for the whole world, is something for which there is a great demand.  I am giving my life and my time to it, though it is what makes me happy.  I do not see the need for me to do anything else, and I don’t think it would be helpful to me or anyone else and I don’t want to have to waste anymore time before I start doing what I must do.  By wasting time, I mean, being in a situations where I can’t explore feelings and different modes of behavior, which is what I must do.    
**It has been often said that nobody’s perfect.  At the risk of sounding crazy to you, I will tell you that everybody’s perfect.**  They don’t know it though.  Look at nature.  Examine the perfection of its cycles and remember that people are included in that.  Then look into the soul of some deep friend with whom you share a mutual trust, then you will see what I mean.  Jesus Christ is one who realized his perfection and his unbreakable link to a perfect world.  Man cannot kill “life” entirely, but it will kill man if man becomes death or persists in his killings of nature.  
Enough phylosophy.  
I am most certainly trying to use you, most certainly not trying to abuse you.  I don’t know how much it means to you to help me get a farm.  To me it means my whole life which should last a long time yet.  
I guess you know I love you very much.  If after this you need further clarifications, don’t hesitate to write and ask me.  Ask me whatever you want, at whatever level,  I want you to understand and will be glad to answer.  
I have made 10$ carrot picking today.  So we do have some earning power, though not great.  
Much love again,  
	Gaëtane.  
P.s. \- If you want to show this letter to mother, that is fine by me.  She doesn’t seem to quite understand what is going on either.   Not that I blame her.  I hope this letter helps and that you take everything I have said seriously.  Exept for the part about showing it to my mother, everything has been said seriously.  I have quiet feelings about having talked to her on the phone for so long this evening, especially when we were fighting the whole time.  
	**You’re right, she doesn’t want you to lend me money.  Oh well.  I guess I’m not the most responsible person in the world.  Things like money are utterly beyond me.  I’m always under the impression that it grows on trees, though I don’t recall having actually seen it happen.  Trees would grow on money though.**    
	I think I have told you everything.  From now on, it’s all yours.  
	Take care of yourself.

Oct 26th ‘71  
Dear Mrs Millar,  
	I am so stupid I should have written to you ages ago, I don’t think you really understand, what goes on with Gaëtane.  She will never be able to work at any job, as she is not normal, you must know that she is absolutely unemployable that is why we wanted you to get her a place of her own.  
	After your letter, with the clippings (all of which were irrelevant) she put on a dress of Mary’s & my shoes & she tried to get a job at Woodward’s as a girl, no go, so she tried as a boy \- jeans from a rummage sale, old runners of Michael’s etc., but no luck as a boy either, and if you don’t think this is terribly sad I do, in fact I’m almost in tears now, to think of her valiant efforts to cope with a world she will never be able to cope with.  
	**She is not either a boy or a girl, no amount of psychiatry will ever be able to alter this, she is desperately in love with Rosamund, who is an absolutely beautiful person, loving, & gentle but unable herself to cope with her own life.**  
	Now as I see it you can either lock Bambi up for life or you can help her now.  
	At the moment she has gone off to Saturna Island & is living in the bush in a stick house & it is getting colder & wetter, she went because she feels she is not contributing here towards her keep etc. & I’m sorry if we made her feel that way, at any rate we often have 8-10 young people staying here, so what’s one more\!  
	Now just a word about something we did in my family, 15 years or so ago, for my brother who is schizoid we had a choice, (our parents being dead) to incarcerate him in a mental home, or get him a house of his own.  This is what we did, my 3 sisters & my older brother & myself all contributed & bought him a huge ramshackle old manor house in the UK & he has lived there happily in an awful muddle & is now 60 years old & will live there until he dies, we send him a little money & old clothes & the villagers understand about him & are kind, a sort of glorified village idiot situation.    
	Please help Bambi now.  Get her that place, it is beautiful.  Offer them $14,000 cash, my sensible children (Mary & her husband & Caroline) will help her set it up, I’m sure dear Peter will help too, ie roof the log house etc. & then she can keep a goat, some chicken & rabbits for food, grow a bit of corn & keep a house & live happily.  At any rate give it a try, it might work out, a lot of young people will help Gaëtane I am sure.  
	Any rate you must not just leave her alone now on Crown Zellerbach, with winter coming & **I cannot think you really want her locked up like her mother suggested in an asylum near her in France.**  
		With kindest regards,	  
				Isabel Hunt (Mrs. I. H. Vane Hunt)  
P.s. I am sending Gaëtane’s BC medical insurance bill to Mr. Poul(?), she hs needed a few things already, & it will be better to carry insurance, it’s $60 a year this year, but only $6 next year as she will be a BC resident.  
	I see this does not cover hospital benefits & I think I’ll look & find out about that as I feel she should be covered.  
			I.M.H.  
P.p.s. I feel rereading this that I am interfering in your family, if you feel the same please try to forgive me, it’s only because I’m gravely concerned about your granddaughter.  
							I.M.H.

**gae012** 

Dear Grandmère \-   
	I appreciate very much your being concerned over my mental outlook, but I think that we may have somewhat conflicting ideas about what is best for me.  
	I know that if you could have me in another mental hospital, you would.  I don’t feel that is what I need.  I don’t feel that my stay at Chestnut Lodge has done me any good, nor would any amount of time in some other hospital.  
	If it is of my involvement with drugs you are worried about, as of last Friday, you needn’t be.  I am NEVER going to take any kind of drug again.  This may sound like a rather rash decision for me who had previously felt that drugs would bring about valuable learning experiences.  It is not.  I will not do anything that I feel can do me physical or mental damage which outweighs in any way the benefit I can get out of it.  
	I feel that though drugs may have helped me understand a few things, I can derive no further benefit from it.  I also feel that they are largely responsible for whatever nerve damage I may have.  I don’t think that any permanent harm has been done but however irresponsible I may seem to you, my health is not something I care to gamble nor is my sanity.  Knowing also that drugs can induce psychosis is further reason for me not to go near them.  I hope you see how serious I am about the finality of this.  
	**I know that two psychiatrists can certify a person, regardless of custody, civil rights, etc.  That is why I will not go and see the two you have arranged for me to see.  During my stay at Chestnut Lodge, I have seen enough reasonably sane people certified to be naturally wary of anything like that.**  
	I do not intend to take mental patiency as my career like so many other people I’ve seen have.  
	You see grandmother, I know I can get much more out of a good homy environment where people are working together as well as caring about each other.  I have realized during my stay on Saturna just how much I care about the free school and the people there, and how much they care about me.  I would like to stay there and help them get it back into working shape, then, when it reopens, become a staff member there.  I would also like to do some pottery and various other arts and crafts, the tools for which are available on Saturna.  
	Mainly thought, I am tired of wandering around aimlessly all over the countryside.  It is a real strain and I would just like to settle down with people whom I feel comfortable with.  
	The possibility for my finishing high school is of course open.  I have too many things to sort out in my head to really feel inspired about doing it, right at this time, but I think that in time, and with a little perseverance, I will probably do it someday.  Let’s say I do not have my feelings strongly set against it, though I don’t think you should try and push me.  
	Generally things seem to be settling down quite a bit and I am sorting out quite a few things in my mind.  
	I hope things are going well with you.  
	Much love,  
		Gaëtane

**gae013** 

Chère Madame,  
	Hier, Fiona m’a téléphoné au sujet de Gaëtane.  Ainsi, épisodiquement, soit par Fiona, soit par Gaëtane elle-même, je suis tenu au courant.  A plusieurs reprises j’ai désiré vous écrire et je pense que j’aurai dû le faire plus tôt.  
	A Gaëtane j’ai écrit assez souvent des lettres de bon sens l’exhortant à travailler et rejeter toute drogue.  A Fiona il m’est arrivé de faire des suggestions pour que je m’occupe de ma fille.  
	Il est infiniment malheureux pour cela que ma situation financière soit précaire car, à chaque proposition de ma part, Fiona me reprochait de faire de sombres calculs.  Selon lesquels, Frédérique et Gabriel vivraient au crochet de Gaëtane.  C'est-à-dire: de vous-même.   
	Certes, j’ai toujours eu un grand respect pour vous et tout ce que vous avez essayé de faire mais ce n’est pas sans peines ni regrets que je vois le chemin qu’à pris Gaëtane justement malgré tout ce que vous avez déjà fait pour elle.  
	Je ne sais pas exactement dans quel état elle se trouve, mais s’il est encore temps de la sauver, je me permets de faire la proposition suivante:  Que Gaëtane vienne à Paris et qu’avec votre aide, l’on puisse lui faire suivre un traitement s’il y a lieu, que d’autre part je puisse m’occuper d’elle et la diriger dans une voie réaliste et constructive et l’entourer d’affection.  Elle pourrait suivre quelques cours (gravure céramique ou autres.)  Elle irait de temps en temps (pour les vacances) au mas mais bien entendu pas pour s’y installer et travailler dans les champs comme le veut Fiona car elles ne resteraient pas huit jours ensemble sans que cela se termine par un drame.  J’ajoute que je vous tiendrais minutieusement au courant \-   
	Je vous serai reconnaissante de me répondre pour me dire ce que vous en pensez.  
	Quoiqu’il en soit, je vous prie d’accepter mes meilleurs sentiments.  
										Paul  
**Gae014**

Dear Mrs. Millar:  
	In response to your letter of November 3, we can appreciate your concern about Gaetane.  She has written letters to staff members here also which would indicate that she is in a very confused situation, to say the least.  Dr. Fort, out Clinical Director, states that the Lodge would be willing to have her back but we understand that she does not want to come back and this might make the situation quite difficult if she is, in fact, legally married.  We would imagine a court procedure would be required.  Whether or not  her husband would cooperate would be a major issue unless, of course, the conditions were such that an annulment of the marriage could also be arranged.    
	Treatment might be difficult if Gaetane bitterly opposed it but we would be willing to try.  If you wish to pursue this further, I would imagine you would need to consider, with your lawyer, what steps might be taken.  
Sincerely yours,  
Mrs. Helene Mayock  
Psychiatric Social Worker

**gae015**  
Dear Grandmother,  
	I have in me a great tension and fear.  Underneath that fear is anger, and still deeper is pain.  Very great pain.  If I can feel that pain, it will stop bothering me, my anger and my fear will go because they are products of the pain.  If I can feel that pain, my other feelings which I have also lost will come crowding back and I will not feel so empty, but I will feel myself and the things around me without symbolism.  If I can feel that pain, I will not necessarily be always happy, but at least I will feel on a deeper level and will not need to fight myself so hard because I will be alright.    
	I have just written to Art Janov who wrote “The Mind Scream” asking him for information on Primal Therapy.  His theory is that my neurosis has been caused by pain which if felt at the time (very early childhood) would have devastating results.  That pain is caused by the child feeling unloved.  So the child represses it, but the pain is still there, and all his life, the patient lives around the pain, looking for something to fill the void, whether it is smoking, overeating, or whatever.  The person, to feel whole, has to get into that Primal pain, feel it in all its intensity (he has had people scream and roll on the floor in agony) whatever it may be.  When the patient has lived through that pain stored from childhood, he has consistently found himself whole again.  
	Art Janov who used to be a conventional therapist made this discovery when during a session he asked a patient to call for his mommy.  In a few moments the patient was writhing on the floor in pain and a loud scream came from him.  When he had experienced that fully he said “I made it.  I don’t know what, but I can FEEL.”  When this happened to another of his patients Dr. Janov decided to investigate it.  
	As you have probably gathered, I would like to try Primal therapy.  There is first 3 weeks of individual therapy in which nobody else is seen and where one by one the defenses are broken down.  Then there is approximately 8 months of group therapy \- (it varies from patient to patient).  The group meets twice a week for about 2 hours and is a necessary part of the therapy.  After that, the patient is cured.  
	From what I gathered from the book, the costs are not too great, but if you want to get a better idea of what its about, I suggest you read the book, or you could write to Art Janov at 620 N Almont, Los Angeles, Cal, 90069\.  
	There is one problem though.  There might not be a primal therapist in Canada, in which case I would have to go to California for a while.  It is possible that my old visa is still valid.  I don’t know.  Please tell me what you think.  If something could get me out of this mess, I can’t even say how grateful I would be.  **See, I never really did feel loved as a child, not to my memory anyway.  I understand mother and father tried hard, but they just didn’t have it in them to take care of me, when they, at least mother, needed parents themselves.**  What primal therapy does is eliminate that need by violently overthrowing the neuroses which hides the pain and imitating a direct confrontation between the conscious mind and that devastating pain and loneliness and emptiness.  At the end of therapy, the patient finds that he is only himself, but that is good enough.  
	I believe that it works enough to want to try it.  If it works I may consider being a primal therapist myself.  There is not one person I can think of who does not need it to some extent.    
	Here’s hoping to hear from you soon.  Merry Christmas.  Much love,  
										Gaëtane.  
Dec. 21st 71  
Dear Gaëtane  
	Your letter arrived today.  I have been to 2 bookstores and a library but did not find the book you mentioned.  They asked if it was hardcover or paperback.  I do remember reading or hearing something about primal therapy.  I do think it makes sense.  
	I think you or your husband or Mr Pool will have to write Ottawa about your passport.  
	In the meantime, I would suggest that you see the psychiatrist you have already seen & consult him about this.  He probably would have access to the different branches etc.  In the meantime it might help if you saw him once a week pending possible arrangements for some alternative therapy.  
	Michel has mailed you a short kilt skirt from your mother, who has not arrived yet.  We hope she will come before Christmas.  We shall miss you & be thinking of you.  
		Much love, in haste  
				Grandmère

**gae016**

Dear Grandmother,  
	I wish you a very good Christmas.  I have a present for you, but it will not get to you until your birthday.  It is well worth waiting for.  Things have been in a state of change for me these days.  Sometimes things are good, sometimes not.  My eyes are still not right, so I’m taking vitamins and going to see the eye doctor next week.  
	It is snowing tonight for the 1st time this year.  There is snow all over the ground and it’s really quiet and beautiful.  
	Have you heard from mother?  Since she wrote me that perfectly horrible letter, I haven’t heard from her. **Maybe she needs somebody to feel hostile towards.  I wish she’d pick somebody else.**   
	I am getting along quite well with the people here.  If I felt just a little better, I could improve on things a lot.  But I suppose time will solve things and I believe in my strength(?).  
	Please give my love to Dora and Papples(?).  I think I’ll go to bed, it’s late.  
Much love,  
	Gaëtane

**gae017**   
Dear Grandmother,  
	I have written you an invitation to come around Christmas if you would like.  It wasn’t actually my idea but it is a nice one, and though I doubt you can make it, you would be very welcome.  I must admit it is a little late though.  It will probably be Christmas day when you receive this.  Have a good one\!  
	With me things are going as best they can.  Sometimes it seems like a hopeless uphill road, sometimes things are good.  You may know I'm having certain visual difficulties.  I’m not sure whether they are due to emotional or physical causes or both but I am doing the best I can under the circumstances.  It may be due to pressure on the optic nerves.  I have repeatedly felt pressure in my head, but vitamins seem to help a lot.  I have sometimes gone 2 days with no source of B vitamins, at which point things got much worse, then they got better in a day or two when I started taking them again.  So I must remember that however odd it seems that they should help so much they do and I shouldn’t spurn them other than that ( and there is not much else in my mind at the present) things are fine.  Though it snowed once, it is not too cold.  
	The school has changed a lot since Tom Durrie left.  Or maybe I have changed a lot.  It seems to me he sort of gave life and a purpose to this place.  I miss him a little.  I also miss my friends at the hospital.  It is not good to leave a place when there are people you care about.  I have just heard my good friend and roommate Susan who became an outpatient shortly before I left has gone back to inpatienting.  It is the first time that I have ever heard her say that things are not going well and that sort of thing makes me want to take the next plane.  But even if I could, I have travelled too much as it is this summer, and I should like to stay in one place as much as possible until I feel better and more able to take care of myself.  Sometimes I wish it was more structured here.  
	As for Primal therapy, it seems they are now having a massive training program to train people to do it.  The snag is you need an MA.  I vaguely thought of buying an MA on the black market, but I dislike that kind of shortcut.  
	I have confidence that I will get back on my feet soon thought.  The sooner the better but I don’t know when that will be.  Don’t worry, I am doing the best I can.  
	Here’s hoping you feel better than I do and that you have a good Christmas.  If mother and kids do come over, tell them how much I’d like to see them and that they’ve also been invited here.  Also wish them the best of Christmasses.  
Much love,  
	Gaëtane  
P.s. \- I am sorry I am still depending on you.  I guess for the time being I need to.

Chère Madame,   
Je vous remercie pour votre lettre du 12\.  J’ai également reçu une longue lettre de Gaëtane remplie de bonnes résolutions.  Je suis désolé pour le phare plié.  Je m’en suis souvenu à la lecture de votre lettre.  Est-ce le sort des phares pliés de se transformer en bateau?  Je vous envoies mes meilleurs souhaits pour la nouvelle année et j'espère que vous avez passé une bonne fête de Noël.

**gae019**   
Dear Mummy,  
	I had quite a good trip back, although I didn’t even try to sleep.  A pleasant read and then I looked at the movie (which was rather silly) and then breakfast and then we’d arrived \- ahead of time even though we left late.  
	I saw Paul as soon as I got here (luckily the phone hadn’t been cut off) and kept him abreast of recent events.  He feels as I do that Gaëtane will need more psychiatric care.  It is unfortunate that she did not get involved in some activity which would have forced her to snap out of it.  **Now that the Benthams have her she will be more or less forced to go to school \- write her matric, which is what we’ve been wanting for some time, so let’s keep out of it and wait and see.**  
	As the taxi-driver said I have “retrouvé mon quartier” and it’s a wonderful feeling.  When I was with Michael in the taxi I suddenly caught a glimpse of the mountain and Saint Joseph’s oratory and I said “Oh I do love Montreal\!”  But now I am saying “Oh I do love Paris\!”  I didn’t want to go to Paul & Frédérique for dinner because I have so much to think about and don’t want to think in French until I’ve got the Canadian trip settled in my mind and various letter written.  There’s a little grocery shop next door which is open on Sundays and I have just had supper \- two feuilles de vigne farcies (which is really a Greek specialty), a Rollmops, which is a pickled herring (?) rolled around a pickled cucumber with onion, and then a gorgeous camembert, runny right through, with rye bread and a little more than half a bottle of Vin de Pays du Dept. des Bouches du Rhone Cuvée spéciale.  The food tastes so good\!  Even without it being cooked in some special way it tastes so much better than in Canada \- could it be the water?  
	It is raining on the roof outside my window and I’m falling asleep listening to it.  
With much love, Fiona.  
P.s. By the way, did you write to the lawyer in Vancouver about stopping G’s allowance?  And have you seen Mr. Stead?  
Peter’s address is:  954 West 7th, Vancouver, and to phone him you dial 1.604.738.2610.  I don’t imagine he’ll appreciate too many phone calls because he asked me to pass the message on to his mother that he didn’t want her to interfere in any way.  You could perhaps get Mr. Stead to phone him if anything comes up.  
	By the way, I got the vitamins from that credit at the drug store and I’ve kept them for me (as a little birthday present).  Is that O.K.?

**gae020**

Dear Mr Fetherstonhaugh,  
	I’m sorry that after the efforts you made towards getting my divorce through as quickly and simply as possible, I will not be able to attend.  
	As you tell me it is not possible to divorce me without my being there, we should try to consider other alternatives.  One would be to have Peter take the initiative.  As it could still be done on the grounds of a three-year separation, it would cause no embarrassment on any ones part.  If Peter would consent to this, it may yet be the best way of obtaining this divorce.  The other alternatives are for me to come at some future date, or to divorce me from France.  They both may present considerable difficulty, the first as I cannot afford to take the time off school, the second, for obvious reasons. You may be able to come up with other alternatives, if so, please do not hesitate to write.  
	Please accept my thanks, and my apologies as to the suddenness of my leave.  
Yours truly,  
	G Pratchett

We attended at Court yesterday and filed the document; and now must wait approximately 90 days after which time we will again attend at court and file document asking for your Divorce to be confirmed, trusting there will be no dispute from Mr. Pratchett.

In the meantime, we will keep you advised and will send you a certified court copy of your judgment of divorce when it is available.

P.s. Could you send me a cheque to cover the Vancouver account, either payable to the Undersigned or directly to Farris Vaughan Wills & Murphy.  
Me. Poole is a first class man and has, I think, taken a personal interest in straightening out this matter.
