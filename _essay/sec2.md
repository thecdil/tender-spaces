I grew up in a world that was opening up to queerness. Gay marriage was legalized in Canada the year I graduated high school, but my mother, a minister, had been performing the ceremonies for years.  As a teenager, I felt at once safe enough to be queer, and aware of the obstacles that queer people faced in the world. I learned about Oscar Wilde, imprisoned for indecency, about Harvey Milk's assassination. I remember the death of Matthew Shepherd, watched Boys Don't Cry and learned about the murder of Brandon Teena. There was a kind of absolute violence - the indisputable kind mapped by prison sentences and gunshot wounds - that I understood to be part of my world.

But there is another kind of violence, one that is so often cloaked in the rhetoric of care. In my teenage years, I parsed the covert threats of Christian morality to my own identity. I heard about conversion therapy, I attended a youth group at a local church that made it clear they would not welcome an openly gay member. These messages were bound up in the language of benevolence: we want you to be well, we want you to be saved. I was lucky enough to feel strong and supported in my own identity, and turned squarely towards communities that would embrace me. Others I knew found themselves between a choice to stay with their families, to attend therapy with dubiously-trained counselors who undermined their sense of selves, or to lose their communities, their housing, their support networks.

At twenty-five I worked for an outreach team supporting LGBTQ+ youth.  They had all been kicked out of their homes, after failing to become the kind of person their families had hoped.  At thirty-three, I looked for a marriage counselor in my town in Tennessee.  Time after time, I found they had been trained at the same local Christian university that had expelled more than one of my friends for coming out as gay.

I think about Gaëtane's _bêtises,_ and wonder about that violence disguised as care.  Had she felt it, that contradiction she kept bumping up against?  Were these antics just reactions to an impossible circumstance?
