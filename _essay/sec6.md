*You know, people are very, very sensitive. No one takes into account how sensitive a person really is… Everybody is terribly sensitive. And other people don’t understand how sensitive a human being is. They don’t understand it. So they run roughshod over everybody.*  
― Edith Bouvier Beale, *Grey Gardens*
