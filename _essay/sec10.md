Gaëtane does not speak ill of her mother.  She tells me about her childhood in a kind of passive voice, that she had gone to this school, then that one, that even while she acted out in hopes of being home again, she ended up here and there, boarded with a woman in Aramon, a Steiner school in England, a lycée in Montpellier, living with Nell in Canada. As she tells me her stories, she seems self-effacing – she laughs at her antics, at the way her childhood was marked by a cycle of exile and return.
