I can’t write about Gaëtane without writing about our family, and I can’t write about our family without thinking about Grey Gardens. In some ways, it’s an unfair comparison, although perhaps if Little Edie had had children, they would have been grounded and capable, as both my mother and Gaëtane grew up to be. But there is no question that ours is a family that has subsisted on delusions of grandeur.  

The origin of this grandeur is real. A real estate empire, a sugar refinery, a senate appointment and a knighthood preceded Dot and her children. But by Dot’s generation, the money that remained was in trust, no longer accumulating, but funding a privileged life for Dot, and a sheltered one for her children. We are a family in decline, my uncle once said to me, and measured in wealth and social standing, he is right.  

While she didn’t need to work, Dot spent her life studying, earning a bachelor’s degree the same year as her eldest daughter, then a master’s in French literature. She audited medical courses at Dartmouth, despite the school not admitting women as medical students until many years later. Once her children left home, she took over the management of St Margaret’s Home for the Incurables, established, in part by her own grandfather, in the late 19th century.<span class="aside">Some [doctors] optimistically asserted that they were easily cured; others saw them as all but inherently incurable, the product of an irreversible and inexorably fatal constitutional ﬂaw.<br><br>
