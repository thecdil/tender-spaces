Hélène is preparing for _la cousinade._ She picks up a case of wine from the cooperative vineyard, fusses around their yard. Her niece comes over to play with Témis, who never runs out of energy. An electrician is working in the studio, then sits down with us for lunch – I learn that he lived with them for a year, when he was out of work and raising a toddler on his own. Hélène steps out to check on a friend, who is ninety and can no longer leave her home. A neighbor comes over, smokes a cigarette by the pool and chats with Hélène’s niece. We go for lunch, push three tables together, passing the tapenade one way and the breadbasket the other.

Gaëtane tells me that when she and Hélène got married after being together for 33 years, she asked her mother if she was happy for them. Fiona, her mother, said no.

_All she wants to do is paint,_ Fiona wrote plaintively in a letter to my great-grandmother.

Gaëtane shows me around her art studio. It is built into a loft above the barn, and she holds the railing as she climbs the steep stairs. She wears her pajamas still, a faded gray set with pinstripes, and I can see the way her back curves through the thin cotton.

We have to step up and duck through a doorway to get in, and the entryway is crammed with canvases. Stacks of paintings line the walls, stand on shelves and lean against the wood stove at the center of the room. Enormous paper lanterns hang from the high ceiling, and dried paint palettes rest on the tables. Gaëtane sits on an old barber stool, her toes grazing the floor. She is beaming, amused by my exclamations as I point around the room, wide-eyed.

Gaëtane sketched a cat and a unicorn at the top of a letter to my great-grandmother. She wrote: _You see, I want to paint and make and create things. The only job that I would get pleasure doing and which is within my means is that._

On my last day at the Mas, I skim ants and flies off the surface of the pool. I crouch in the water and scoop up the tiny snails that drift in the shallows. Témis steals my towel from the arm of the cracked lawn chair. Oleander blossoms litter the grass. I am sometimes overwhelmed by the smells of this place; everything is damp and fertile.

When I came here the first time as a teenager, I felt like I had arrived in a kind of paradise.  Then, as now, the house was a work in progress – there were chickens, but no coop, and the birds ran free around the property.  I spent hours in the pool, shaded by date palms and a walnut tree, splashing around with a neighbor girl named Martine, who was blunt and poised; around her, I stammered, and felt clumsy.

The property is much as I remember it, although everything seems to stand at a different angle, to cast a different shadow.  Things have grown, been built, or begun to rot.  The trailer where my parents had slept is full of firewood.  It has rotted out, dwarfed now by the fruit trees that rise above it, its siding flecked with the amaranth flesh of fallen plums. Plantain shoots grow through the cracked cement around the pool.  The chickens are now sequestered under the walnut tree, although they strain their heads through the net enclosure, their necks bald from the effort.

Back in the kitchen, Hélène tucks a chocolate wafer into my backpack, and a leftover curried chicken sandwich from lunch. I stumble through thanks, promise to return, apologize that I don’t have the words for what I want to tell them.

    _Put that in your story, _Gaëtane says, about something else, I don’t remember what.
