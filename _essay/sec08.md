It feels insensitive to consider the ways that this privilege may have hurt us. By all accounts, it embarrassed Dot, who drove a sensible car while her sister drove a Jaguar. But her shame about money, or maybe a societal precedent that permits the privileged to look away demurely when identified, seemed only to obscure reality for her daughters. who moved through life with the sense that there was an endless source of money somewhere, if only they could find their way to it.  Dot herself, while capable in many ways, left the finances to the men in her life, her father, then husband, then, after their divorce, the bankers.  Her three daughters, perhaps, learned from her that money was not theirs to understand.    

In the painting, the siblings look more unified than I ever remember. During my lifetime, they all lived thousands of kilometers apart; Huntley moved to Texas, all but cut himself off from the family. Nell moved out West, tended to people’s horses, Fiona moved to France and married an artist. I wonder if they corresponded with one another, or if they kept up through their children. When Nell died, my grandmother didn’t remember ever having known her very well.
