Mas Lombard faces the city of Nîmes on one side, faces a potato field on the other, although neither can be seen from the property; a line of poplar trees stands to the East, clusters of fruit trees hide the city to the West. An old stone wall is hidden under madeira ivy and passion flower vines. They creep up the sides of the house, lacing through the iron grilles of the upstairs windows. In the summer, meals are taken in the courtyard, and a dense Bourbon rose is trained above the tables, extending the shade of the house.

Gaëtane and Hélène had been together for three years when they bought the Mas. The roof needed to be replaced, and the windows, and the plaster siding had crumbled in patches, exposing the stone structure underneath. The barn, which had been appropriated by the French Army to house Laotian workers during World War I, was badly in need of repair. A map of Laos was still faintly visible, painted up to the roofbeams on the South wall.

I am in town for five days, on my way to a writing workshop, and I am using the trip to Europe to visit my French cousin and her wife for the first time in my adult life. They collect me at the train station, and we take a harrowing drive through the narrow streets of Nîmes before suddenly hinging onto a gravel road and pulling up to their gate. Gaëtane is eager to walk me around the property. She shows me the fruit trees - plum, apricot, apple, pear, fig, olive - and her little garden, tutting in disappointment at her blighted potatoes. Their dog, Témis, bounds alongside us, a manic Doberman puppy, already stronger than each of his elderly owners.

Inside their kitchen, a pot of what looks to be apricot jam cools on the stove - it will remain there for the duration of my visit. A cluster of uncorked bottles of wine sits on the counter. That night, Hélène will sniff each one cautiously, unsure which had been opened the night before, and which had been there for weeks. Through to the living room, a baby grand barely clears the doorframe. On top of it, a carved jade ship, maybe a meter long and half as high, gathers dust next to a pile of mail and keys and dog treats. Gaëtane’s paintings hang on every wall.

My only other visit here had been when I was thirteen years old, and there was so much catching up to do. As a teenager, I was hungry for examples of queerness in the world. During that first visit, I wanted to watch Gaëtane and Hélène just exist in their home, as remarkable or mundane as it was at any moment. I wanted to see them hold hands, to watch them interact with shopkeepers, to meet the friends they had over for Sunday lunch. But our stay was brief, and I could not yet articulate what it was that drew me to them.

A few days after I arrive, we are drinking coffee in the courtyard.  It is unceremonious, the way Gaëtane tells me about Chestnut Lodge. _I was sent to a psychiatric hospital for ten months when I was eighteen, for being a lesbian,_ she told me. _Mais je faisais toutes sortes de bêtises. _I must look shocked. This is a part of her history I had never known, that my mother never mentioned. What kind of _bêtises, _what kind of antics would merit almost a year in a psychiatric facility?

~

I grew up in a world that was opening up to queerness. Gay marriage was legalized in Canada the year I graduated high school, but my mother, a minister, had been performing the ceremonies for years.  As a teenager, I felt at once safe enough to be queer, and aware of the obstacles that queer people faced in the world. I learned about Oscar Wilde, imprisoned for indecency, about Harvey Milk’s assassination. I remember the death of Matthew Shepherd, watched Boys Don’t Cry and learned about the murder of Brandon Teena. There was a kind of absolute violence - the indisputable kind mapped by prison sentences and gunshot wounds - that I understood to be part of my world.

But there is another kind of violence, one that is so often cloaked in the rhetoric of care. In my teenage years, I parsed the covert threats of Christian morality to my own identity. I heard about conversion therapy, I attended a youth group at a local church that made it clear they would not welcome an openly gay member. These messages were bound up in the language of benevolence: we want you to be well, we want you to be saved. I was lucky enough to feel strong and supported in my own identity, and turned squarely towards communities that would embrace me. Others I knew found themselves between a choice to stay with their families, to attend therapy with dubiously-trained counselors who undermined their sense of selves, or to lose their communities, their housing, their support networks.

At twenty-five I worked for an outreach team supporting LGBTQ+ youth.  They had all been kicked out of their homes, after failing to become the kind of person their families had hoped.  At thirty-three, I looked for a marriage counselor in my town in Tennessee.  Time after time, I found they had been trained at the same local Christian university that had expelled more than one of my friends for coming out as gay.

I think about Gaëtane’s _bêtises,_ and wonder about that violence disguised as care.  Had she felt it, that contradiction she kept bumping up against?  Were these antics just reactions to an impossible circumstance?

        	While religious moral conventions had condemned homosexuality as sinful since the first millennium AD, the idea of deeming homosexuality to be a pathological condition was advanced by Richard von Krafft-Ebbing in the late 1800’s. Krafft-Ebbing, a Darwinian psychiatrist, considered homosexuality to be a form of psychopathology, a disease that worked against the interests of reproduction. In his essay “Queer Diagnoses Revisited,” Jack Drescher writes:


    The now-discredited degeneracy theory that informed Krafft-Ebing’s approach was nevertheless influential in disseminating among medical and scientific communities both the term ‘homosexual’ as well as the conceptualization of homosexuality as a psychiatric disorder. In an ironic twist of the modern ‘born gay’ theory, Krafft-Ebing believed that although one might be born with a homosexual predisposition, such inclinations should be considered a congenital disease (Queer Diagnoses, 386).

While many psychiatrists in the century that followed had differing views on why humans exhibited a range of sexual interests, the notion of homo- or bisexuality as a pathology to be cured had gained a foothold in psychiatric discourse. Aside from the notable exception of Sigmund Freud, who wrote: “Homosexuality is assuredly no advantage, but it is nothing to be ashamed of, no vice, no degradation; it cannot be classified as an illness; we consider it to be a variation of the sexual function, produced by a certain arrest of sexual development” (Freud), homosexuality in the 19th and early 20th century was characterized as a mental illness and a medical aberration.

In this formative era of psychiatric practice, much effort was put into uncovering the root cause of homosexuality. This, of course, was informed by the central idea of homosexuality as an identifiable error in the human composition. Havelock Ellis and John Raymond Symmons published a book called “Sexual Inversion,” which forwarded the notion that homosexuality was a congenital condition rooted in evolutionary variance.


    Specifically, he argued that sexual inversion could be compared to color blindness… and to instinctive criminality…Humans had been born with a congenital, naturally varying physiological response to sensory input… For the sexual invert, the person was born with a tumescent response to the sights, sounds, and smells normally reserved for the other sex (Alaniz, 19).

This line of thought set the psychiatric field up for a grim era of experimentation. Testing the alteration of hormones and the physical body itself, practitioners and theorists attempted to trace the evolutionary characteristics that determined a person’s sexual orientation, with the goal of reversing this supposed defect.

Among experimental treatments for homosexuality, the most commonly practiced was called aversion therapy. Aversion therapy, at its most damaging, subjected patients to electric shocks when they exhibited any response to images or sensations that confirmed their same-sex attraction. Chemical emetics were also used, to induce nausea or vomiting, in attempts to conflate the pain of this experience with any expression of homosexuality. The result of these treatments, while often documented by practitioners themselves as resulting in short-term successes, relied so heavily on shame as a motivator that they are now understood to have produced longer term psychiatric conditions such as anxiety, depression, and PTSD. Some of these treatments are documented in “Hidden from History? A Brief Modern History of the Psychiatric “Treatment” of Lesbian and Bisexual Women in England”:


    Four cases of “anticipatory avoidance therapy” were recorded at Crumpsall Hospital in north Manchester between 1962 and 1967 (MacCulloch and Feldman, 1967; Feldman and MacCulloch, 1971). This was a variant of aversion therapy, involving mild electric shocks, pioneered by psychologists in the hospital's department of psychiatry, with the full support of the medical director… Although these were often reported as “successful” in the literature, women reported that it made them feel “terrible” for months, and that although it resulted in them not being able to act on their attraction to women, at least for a period of time, it did not make them more attracted to men. We also found an unverified account of a woman dying by suicide following aversion therapy in a hospital in the north east of England (Carr, 290).

In 1952, the first Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) was released by the American Psychiatric Association (Queer Diagnoses, 389). This was intended to be a comprehensive listing of psychiatric diagnoses, and in this original issue, homosexuality was listed as a sociopathic personality disturbance and sexual deviation. At this point, treatments for homosexuality had been incorporated into many psychiatric hospitals and treatment regimens. Grouped together with broader personality disorders, homosexuality was subjected to the larger “corrective” moral frameworks in the postwar years.  In her book _Private Practices_, Naoko Wake writes:


    Psychologists, sociologists and anthropologists shared an urgent sense of responsibility– that scientists must help the nation to use victory in the war to reestablish social order and create promises of a better future.  In their discussion, the dissociation of families, changing gender relationships, and “immature” personalities were of central concern (195).

With this urgent call for moral restoration, the stage was set for both the political persecution (which would come with the Cold War,) and a dangerously patronizing medical view of homosexuality.

Barbara Gittings, a gay rights activist during the 1960s and 1970s who worked to redefine homosexuality as natural, writes:


    “It’s difficult to explain to anyone who didn’t live through that time how much homosexuality was under the thumb of psychiatry. The sickness label was an albatross around the neck of our early gay rights groups… Some brutal methods for curing us in vogue at one time included incarceration in mental hospitals, lobotomies, and aversion therapy. The latter is where they show you pictures of the “wrong” kind of sexual partner and give you an electric shock, and then show you pictures of a person you _should_ like and play nice music to persuade you to change your choice of sexual partner. There were of course other efforts at curing homosexuality that were less physically brutal, including psychotherapy, but they all thrived on the notion that homosexuality was bad for the individual and for society and should be fixed (American Psychiatry, _xv_).

As the gay rights movement gained traction in the 1950s and 1960s, the American Psychiatric Association came under pressure to soften their framing of homosexuality as a disease. Prominent gay figures and activists were beginning to move the dial of public opinion. While they were still seen as outsiders, and deeply disapproved of in many circles, the growing movement to recognize homosexuality as a natural possibility on the spectrum of human sexuality could no longer be ignored.

In 1973, under pressure from these gay rights movements, the DSM removed homosexuality itself from its listings, leaving in its place something called “sexual orientation disturbance,” the condition of experiencing homosexual desire while simultaneously wishing not to experience it (Queer Diagnoses, 387). Despite these diagnostic changes, however, many psychiatrists who had integrated the notion of homosexuality as a pathology into their daily practice, continued to treat it as such.

        	It is likely impossible to measure the effects of this era of “treatment.” Since any public awareness of a person’s homosexuality could deeply jeopardize their safety and positions in society, both patients and providers were motivated to couch any treatments for homosexuality in euphemistic language.

        	As language and social norms inevitably shift, I find myself unsure of how to analyze the historical context of my cousin’s experience. I take her story at her word, and believe she was subjected to a kind of violence that left deep damage. But there is a complicated privilege at the heart of her story too. Chestnut Lodge was famous for its pioneering psychological treatments.  Committed to psychoanalysis, rather than the increasingly outdated shock treatments and chemical emetics, the facility was likely doing less harm than many others of the era.  Documented in the article “Psychiatry wars: the lawsuit that put psychoanalysis on trial,” Rachel Aviv writes:


    Dexter Bullard, the director of Chestnut Lodge for nearly 40 years, believed that the Lodge could do what no other American hospital had done: psychoanalyze every patient, no matter how far removed from reality they were (as long as they could pay the admission fee). The possibilities of pharmacology did not interest him. His goal was to create an institution that expressed the ethos of the analyst’s office. If a patient appeared beyond the realm of understanding, the institution had failed – its doctors weren’t trying hard enough to see the world through the patient’s eyes.

Chestnut Lodge was a private hospital where people with influence would send family members to be treated discreetly. The administrators of this institution were very aware of what should and should not be put in writing. Long-affiliated with the CIA, this hospital was rumored to have turned down both Judy Garland and Marilyn Monroe in favor of maintaining their low-profile (Plante). The influence of their government affiliations offered protection to people who did not, especially in the wake of the Lavender Scare and McCarthyism, want to be yoked to a diagnosis of homosexuality. Though attempts have been made to track down the medical records of the hospital, there has been no public success in this search.  The facility itself closed in 2001, the building burned to the ground in 2009 (Aviv).  According to the archivist for Montgomery County, the records were either destroyed, burned, or remain privately kept by the Bullard estate (Hedlund).

~

A towering brick building with sweeping lawns and chestnut groves, Chestnut Lodge was, Gaëtane told me, exactly how you would imagine a psychiatric hospital to be at the time. White-coated orderlies walked around the grounds with jangling rings of keys. Access to the wider grounds had to be earned through good behavior. _It broke my mind_, Gaëtane tells me.

**        	**The level of psychiatric damage and medical gaslighting that happened in these facilities, under the auspices of care and treatment, can’t really be calculated. There is little record of Gaëtane’s treatment at Chestnut Lodge, aside from letters they sent to our family. _She has been doing some shopping and more and more is selecting softer feminine things, _they write. _We find her a delightful young lady who is working hard at solving her problem in living._ They do not use the word homosexual, or lesbian.  They only allude to her presentation, her trouble finding a foothold in her own world.

~

        	Ruth Simkin, a young patient at Chestnut Lodge who went on to become a doctor, wrote a memoir, many years after her treatment.  She recounts her psychiatrist simply denying her pronouncement of being a lesbian. On the scale of damaging treatments towards these admissions, this ranks low, but it serves as an interesting acknowledgement of Chestnut Lodge’s strategy for dealing with queer patients. Simkin had originally been placed in treatment for epilepsy, at the time also considered a mental illness.  This meant that she was, however inadvertently, experiencing a kind of compounded gaslighting.  The message she received was that both her epilepsy and her queerness were problems of the mind that could be treated, through talk therapy and willpower (Simkin, 100).  Any lack of success was considered a personal failure.

At the end of her memoir, Simkin writes: “For all the decades that I was a physician, I never forgot my past.  I love medicine and I love being a doctor, but being a physician meant one important thing to me in particular: it meant that I now had the power.  I had the power and no one, no one, was ever going to lock me up again” (214).

I struggled to find personal accounts of people who were treated, at Chestnut Lodge or elsewhere, for this kind of pathologized queerness.  There are medical records, and treatises, but few personal accounts.  I wonder where those stories are held.

~

        	In her essay “Venus in Two Acts,” theorist Saidiya Hartman writes about the ways in which the archives of the American slave trade are populated by stories written by captors. Narratives written by captive Africans are few and far between, and not one known narrative of a captive African woman has survived to this point. Hartman explores the appeal as well as the danger of reconstructing those lost narratives. She writes: “The loss of stories sharpens the hunger for them. So it is tempting to fill in the gaps and to provide closure where there is none. To create a space for mourning where it is prohibited. To fabricate a witness to a death not much noticed” (8). Hartman asks how such a story might be reconstructed while still recognizing that those details are lost to history.  Her questions parallel the questions I want to ask, about the erasure of queer experiences. I count myself as lucky to have my cousin’s direct account of her life, but I am keenly aware of her age, her fallible memory, and the number of similar stories that have been lost. 

Hartmann writes: “And what do stories afford anyway? A way of living in the world in the aftermath of catastrophe and devastation? A home in the world for the mutilated and violated self? For whom—for us or for them?” (3) I continuously ask myself what my own motivations are in piecing my research together. Many people have asked me how I connect to this story, and I don’t yet have an answer. I recognize my bias; I am looking for a narrative that confirms my understanding of the injustices that queer people have been dealt.  On the surface, Gaëtane’s story is clear, but the deeper I dig, the more complex it becomes. Whose version of events is the most reliable?  Do I need to find official confirmation of her story?  Is it possible to define something by its absence, by the histories that are never written down?

In his essay “Gesture, Ephemera, and Queer Feeling”,_ _José Esteban Muñoz explores the relationship between queerness and the rigid frameworks of heterosexuality. Queer identities and culture, Muñoz argues, have long been documented, not in hard-bound historical documents, but in ephemera. This ephemera – rumor, gesture, implication – asks us to look for it, to read the world through a queer lens. This is not to minimize the truth in queer identities, but to understand that there is no objectivity in sexuality in the first place. While expressions of queer identity had to be coded and creatively approached for the safety of any queer person, this practice also highlights the inevitable fluidity of human experience. Muñoz writes:


    Queerness has an especially vexed relationship to evidence. Historically, evidence of queerness has been used to penalize and discipline queer desires, connections, and acts. When the historian of queer experience attempts to document a queer past, there is often a gatekeeper, representing a straight present, who will labor to invalidate the historical fact of queer lives present, past, and future. Queerness is rarely complemented by evidence, or at least by traditional understandings of the term (65).

While I can trust my cousin to be the expert of her own experience, in the archives her treatment is only alluded to, as is the case for many people in her circumstance. Her queerness is one that has been recorded only in her experience, in her daily life, which, as Muñoz explains, is impossible to prove unless one trusts that it is there.

In his essay “Bad Archives,” Paul Soulellis explores the ways that marginalized communities must keep and manage documentation of their own histories. Often, archives necessarily arise outside of official spaces, and are compiled and managed by members of those marginalized communities themselves. Soulellis names these “bad archives” - collections that give members of these groups the authority to tell their own stories, away from the intrusions or dismissals of mainstream society.  Soulellis writes:


    These “bad archives” take form lovingly and messily in private homes, in basements, in closets, in storerooms, and during protest, resulting in dead-end hand-coded web pages, unorganized folders and boxes, YouTube playlists, and other media collections that live beyond the sanitized logic of the institution. These are sometimes unsearchable archives that are cared for by stewards who personally invest time and energy in the survival of queer life, desperately protecting their collections under precarious conditions while maintaining access for the communities they serve (Soulellis, 181-182).

In this sense, Gaëtane’s own version of events will differ from the official records. While she is engaging with her history from the perspective of a queer person who survived institutional violence, the hospital records, were they found, would document a young woman whose mind was in some ways maladaptive, and in need of correction.

**~**

        	Of course, queer people and psychiatrists are not mutually exclusive. Many psychiatrists were instrumental in moving the social needle towards broader acceptance of homosexuality as a natural reality, as well as in advocating to remove homosexuality itself as a pathology listed in the DSM. One such activist was a psychiatrist named Emery Hetrick. Hetrick, a gay man himself, formed an organization called the Institute for the Protection of Lesbian and Gay Youth in 1979, after learning of an incident where a gay teenager had been punished and removed from his housing after being the victim, not the perpetrator, of a gang-rape (American Psychiatry, 183). In her profile of Hetrick in _American Psychiatry and Homosexuality,_ Joyce Hunter writes:


    At that time, despite some social progress, many religious groups and people who had political influence continued to view homosexuality with fear and hatred. Still an issue today, society’s negative attitudes towards homosexuality create special problems for LGBT youth, including shame and alienation, disruption of family ties, and isolation from peers. We knew there were many LGBT youth experiencing physical abuse, who were running away and who were homeless. Some were surviving through involvement in sex work. Unware of any possible available social services–and often afraid of the consequences of disclosure–many young LGBT adolescents were discouraged from seeking the help they needed (American Psychiatry, 184).

I wonder what would have been different, if Gaëtane and Ruth Simkin had been adolescents ten, fifteen years later than they were.  If these resources had been available, if one doctor told them that nothing about them was broken.

~

As I have conducted this research over the past months, for the most part, my findings have confirmed the things I already understood to be true - the evolving rhetoric that, regardless of its modernity, continued to position queer folks as outsiders to society, whether morally or medically, the painful fight for recognition and freedom against institutions that would rather protect their own power.

Despite the changes I have seen in my lifetime, it is not lost on me that we are facing a resurgence of vitriol towards queer people in political and social spheres today. While much progress has been made in granting rights to LGBTQ+ people, we are seeing dangerous rollbacks in policy, and new, strategic ways to undermine safety, especially that of trans people. According to the Trans Legislation Tracker, there are 330 bills under consideration in the United States today, “that seek to block trans people from receiving basic healthcare, education, legal recognition, and the right to publicly exist.”

In Idaho, where I live, legislation has been passed that prevents material that includes any homosexual content from being available to minors, in schools or public libraries.  This bill lists homosexuality under “obscene materials,” alongside masturbation and sexual intercourse.  In Tennessee, where I was once married to another woman, a bill has been introduced to prohibit the certification of marriage licenses between anyone other than a male groom and a female bride (Trans Legislation Tracker).

I wonder which is worse: being criminalized, or being erased.

~

_I escaped and married a man so they couldn’t send me back, _Gaëtane tells me._  _The details she shares are muddy.  After they married, they stayed with friends, worked odd jobs to get by.  She moved back to France, divorced him after a few years, once her parents lost any legal claim over her.  I stumbled through my questions, but she stands.  _What do you call this tree, un charbonnier?_  She walks to the edge of the courtyard, pulls down the branch of a charcoal tree.

I find a letter from her husband to my great-grandmother:  _I would like to dispel any worries you have over the disappearance of Gaëtane.  She will remain with me in hiding until our marriage takes place.  At that time I will become her legal guardian and it is not my intention to permit her to return to Chestnut Lodge.  Regretfully, I cannot sign my name until we feel free from pursuit.  _Then, in a different hand, a curt proof of her presence:  _But I’ll sign mine.  Gaëtane._

People in my community talk about queer family. It’s what we call our cherished friends, who see us, celebrate us, love us in the way that family should, sometimes a supplement to our own families, sometimes the only one we are left with.  Queerness is not a thing we inherit, and as such, queer families are pieced together, through proximity and shared experience.  Some of my friends have fraught relationships with their blood families, some in the slow process of repair, some severed forever - for them, a chosen family is a lifeline.

Gaëtane rescued herself, in the way that anyone must, when the damage is internal.  She was also rescued, by her husband, by Hélène, by the people in her life.  People used to ask me why I moved to Tennessee to get married, why my wife didn’t move to the Northwest, where things would, one would think, feel safer.  It was true, that where I wouldn’t have thought twice about holding my wife’s hand in public, I suddenly lived somewhere that required vigilance, consideration of place and time and company.  But it is also absolutely true that I have found a home in the people I have chosen to build my life with.  For us, safety will not come from institutions of power, but from one another.

~

Hélène is preparing for _la cousinade._ She picks up a case of wine from the cooperative vineyard, fusses around their yard. Her niece comes over to play with Témis, who never runs out of energy. An electrician is working in the studio, then sits down with us for lunch – I learn that he lived with them for a year, when he was out of work and raising a toddler on his own. Hélène steps out to check on a friend, who is ninety and can no longer leave her home. A neighbor comes over, smokes a cigarette by the pool and chats with Hélène’s niece. We go for lunch, push three tables together, passing the tapenade one way and the breadbasket the other.

Gaëtane tells me that when she and Hélène got married after being together for 33 years, she asked her mother if she was happy for them. Fiona, her mother, said no.

~

_All she wants to do is paint,_ Fiona wrote plaintively in a letter to my great-grandmother.

Gaëtane shows me around her art studio. It is built into a loft above the barn, and she holds the railing as she climbs the steep stairs. She wears her pajamas still, a faded gray set with pinstripes, and I can see the way her back curves through the thin cotton.

We have to step up and duck through a doorway to get in, and the entryway is crammed with canvases. Stacks of paintings line the walls, stand on shelves and lean against the wood stove at the center of the room. Enormous paper lanterns hang from the high ceiling, and dried paint palettes rest on the tables. Gaëtane sits on an old barber stool, her toes grazing the floor. She is beaming, amused by my exclamations as I point around the room, wide-eyed.

~

Gaëtane sketched a cat and a unicorn at the top of a letter to my great-grandmother. She wrote: _You see, I want to paint and make and create things. The only job that I would get pleasure doing and which is within my means is that._

~

On my last day at the Mas, I skim ants and flies off the surface of the pool. I crouch in the water and scoop up the tiny snails that drift in the shallows. Témis steals my towel from the arm of the cracked lawn chair. Oleander blossoms litter the grass. I am sometimes overwhelmed by the smells of this place; everything is damp and fertile.

When I came here the first time as a teenager, I felt like I had arrived in a kind of paradise.  Then, as now, the house was a work in progress – there were chickens, but no coop, and the birds ran free around the property.  I spent hours in the pool, shaded by date palms and a walnut tree, splashing around with a neighbor girl named Martine, who was blunt and poised; around her, I stammered, and felt clumsy.

The property is much as I remember it, although everything seems to stand at a different angle, to cast a different shadow.  Things have grown, been built, or begun to rot.  The trailer where my parents had slept is full of firewood.  It has rotted out, dwarfed now by the fruit trees that rise above it, its siding flecked with the amaranth flesh of fallen plums. Plantain shoots grow through the cracked cement around the pool.  The chickens are now sequestered under the walnut tree, although they strain their heads through the net enclosure, their necks bald from the effort.

Back in the kitchen, Hélène tucks a chocolate wafer into my backpack, and a leftover curried chicken sandwich from lunch. I stumble through thanks, promise to return, apologize that I don’t have the words for what I want to tell them.

~


    _Put that in your story, _Gaëtane says, about something else, I don’t remember what.
