The first time I saw Fiona’s house, I was thirteen. She insisted on meeting us at the gate. When my mother asked to see inside, she refused. The house is a mess, I think she said, or, we’re in a hurry.  

Fiona’s house reminds me of my grandmother’s, though it is 450 years older, and on the other side of the Atlantic Ocean. Both sisters have since died – Fiona outlived my grandmother by five years – and both left behind houses full of dust, old magazines, broken things and cat shit.  

At my grandmother’s house, the basement was always full of cat shit. They started going down there once their litter boxes were full, and their litter boxes stayed full for quite some time. The junk room was piled up to the windows with boxes of jam, which had stopped selling long before the business folded, but would keep for years to come. Every morning when the Gazette arrived, my grandmother would cut out the crossword and file it into a shoebox for later. These boxes lined the dining room walls; she finished only two a week, with my uncle’s help.  

When my grandmother was still driving, she used to sway between highway lanes, always taking the shortest path around the curves to save gas. She wrote down gas prices on a flip pad that she stored in the console of her minivan, always recording how much she had spent, at what cost per liter. She ate food long after it went bad \- my mother speculated that her taste buds had stopped working before I was born. We did all we could to avoid her cooking. She would serve moldy casserole, stale bread, frostbitten vegetables, limp greens. I once saw her drop an egg on the floor, bend over, and scoop it back into the shell before dropping it into her frying pan. 

Dot, her mother, had been a millionaire.
