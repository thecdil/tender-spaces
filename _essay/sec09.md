*But you see in dealing with me, the relatives didn't know that they were dealing with a staunch character and I tell you if there's anything worse than dealing with a staunch woman... S-T-A-U-N-C-H. There's nothing worse, I'm telling you. They don't weaken, no matter what.*  

\- Edith Bouvier Beale, *Grey Gardens*  


*Dear Mummy, I haven’t written to you for so long because I’ve been absolutely seething about this whole business.  Your last letter is full of the advice that people have been giving and I know that you always need somebody to tell you what to do so I’ll tell you what I think.*

\-Fiona Millar, 1971<span class="aside">"I don't blame them, I don't blame them. Even my mother... I don't, I don't have any... Any bitterness or resentment towards my mother. My mother, she did what she could, within the limits of what she had."</span>
