As I have conducted this research over the past months, for the most part, my findings have confirmed the things I already understood to be true - the evolving rhetoric that, regardless of its modernity, continued to position queer folks as outsiders to society, whether morally or medically, the painful fight for recognition and freedom against institutions that would rather protect their own power.

Despite the changes I have seen in my lifetime, it is not lost on me that we are facing a resurgence of vitriol towards queer people in political and social spheres today. While much progress has been made in granting rights to LGBTQ+ people, we are seeing dangerous rollbacks in policy, and new, strategic ways to undermine safety, especially that of trans people. According to the Trans Legislation Tracker, there are 330 bills under consideration in the United States today, “that seek to block trans people from receiving basic healthcare, education, legal recognition, and the right to publicly exist.”

In Idaho, where I live, legislation has been passed that prevents material that includes any homosexual content from being available to minors, in schools or public libraries.  This bill lists homosexuality under “obscene materials,” alongside masturbation and sexual intercourse.  In Tennessee, where I was once married to another woman, a bill has been introduced to prohibit the certification of marriage licenses between anyone other than a male groom and a female bride (Trans Legislation Tracker).

I wonder which is worse: being criminalized, or being erased.

_I escaped and married a man so they couldn’t send me back, _Gaëtane tells me._  _The details she shares are muddy.  After they married, they stayed with friends, worked odd jobs to get by.  She moved back to France, divorced him after a few years, once her parents lost any legal claim over her.  I stumbled through my questions, but she stands.  _What do you call this tree, un charbonnier?_  She walks to the edge of the courtyard, pulls down the branch of a charcoal tree.

I find a letter from her husband to my great-grandmother:  _I would like to dispel any worries you have over the disappearance of Gaëtane.  She will remain with me in hiding until our marriage takes place.  At that time I will become her legal guardian and it is not my intention to permit her to return to Chestnut Lodge.  Regretfully, I cannot sign my name until we feel free from pursuit.  _Then, in a different hand, a curt proof of her presence:  _But I’ll sign mine.  Gaëtane._

People in my community talk about queer family. It’s what we call our cherished friends, who see us, celebrate us, love us in the way that family should, sometimes a supplement to our own families, sometimes the only one we are left with.  Queerness is not a thing we inherit, and as such, queer families are pieced together, through proximity and shared experience.  Some of my friends have fraught relationships with their blood families, some in the slow process of repair, some severed forever - for them, a chosen family is a lifeline.

Gaëtane rescued herself, in the way that anyone must, when the damage is internal.  She was also rescued, by her husband, by Hélène, by the people in her life.  People used to ask me why I moved to Tennessee to get married, why my wife didn’t move to the Northwest, where things would, one would think, feel safer.  It was true, that where I wouldn’t have thought twice about holding my wife’s hand in public, I suddenly lived somewhere that required vigilance, consideration of place and time and company.  But it is also absolutely true that I have found a home in the people I have chosen to build my life with.  For us, safety will not come from institutions of power, but from one another.
